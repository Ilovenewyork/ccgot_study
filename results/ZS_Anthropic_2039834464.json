  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"The person buying pork asks, 'Is it 1,500 naira worth of pork or 1,200 naira worth?' Which one did you take from there?\"\n\nThe proverb is making a point about someone asking questions about options (different prices of pork) when they haven't actually purchased anything yet. It's similar to the concept of \"counting your chickens before they hatch\" or making detailed plans about something that isn't yet in your possession."
