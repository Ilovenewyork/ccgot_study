The hawk is a predator that hunts chickens, so it would be absurd for a hawk to expect its prey (the chicken) to serve it by catching insects. \n\nThe proverb teaches that:\n1. Those in positions of power shouldn't expect those beneath them to do work that they themselves should be doing\n2. One shouldn't depend on a subordinate or someone in a weaker position to fulfill one's responsibilities\n3. It's inappropriate to shift your duties to those who should be under your protection\n\nThis is similar to saying \"the boss shouldn't rely on the employee to do the boss's job\" or warning against role reversal where the powerful expect service from the vulnerable."
