  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 ak\u00e0n t\u00f3 k\u00f3 s\u00ed garawa y\u00e8g\u00e8d\u00e8, oj\u00fa t\u00ec \u00ed\" can be translated to English as \"The old crab that is put into a wide-mouthed container is ashamed.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb uses the imagery of a crab, which is known for its sideways movement and difficulty in escaping from containers, to convey a deeper meaning about wisdom and experience. The \"old crab\" symbolizes an elder or someone with experience. The \"wide-mouthed container\" represents a situation that should be easy to navigate or escape from due to the elder's experience. However, if the elder finds themselves trapped or unable to handle the situation, it brings about a sense of shame or embarrassment.\n\nThe proverb highlights the expectation that with age and experience comes the ability to handle situations adeptly. When an elder fails to do so, it can be seen as a failure to live up to the wisdom and capability that is typically associated with age. It serves as a reminder of the importance of living up to one's experience and the potential embarrassment when one does not."
