  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n**Translation:**\n\"A creeping plant that is as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant from going; a creeping plant that says an elephant should not go to Alo, both the creeping plant and the elephant will go there.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis Yoruba proverb uses the imagery of a climbing vine (\u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n) that has grown impressively tall (as tall as a palm tree) but still lacks the strength to restrain an elephant. The proverb emphasizes that despite appearances or claims of power, one cannot prevent what is inevitable or stop someone more powerful from their chosen path.\n\nThe second part reinforces this by suggesting that if the vine attempts to prevent the elephant from going to a specific place (Alo), the vine will actually be dragged along with the elephant - meaning that not only will the attempt fail, but the one trying to obstruct will be carried along by the force they tried to resist.\n\nThis proverb teaches about recognizing power dynamics and the futility of opposing forces much greater than oneself. It counsels humility and wisdom in choosing one's battles, particularly against those with significantly more power or authority."
