  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll analyze it step by step:\n\n1) Breaking down the components:\n   - \"Id\u00e0\" means \"sword\" or \"cutlass\" in Yoruba\n   - \"ahun\" refers to a \"tortoise\"\n   - \"la fi\" means \"is what is used to\"\n   - \"\u0144pa\" means \"to kill\"\n   - \"ahun\" again refers to \"tortoise\"\n\n2) Putting it together literally:\n   \"The tortoise's sword/cutlass is what is used to kill the tortoise\"\n\n3) Understanding the meaning:\n   This proverb suggests that someone's own weapon, creation, or words can be turned against them. It's similar to the English expressions \"hoist by one's own petard\" or \"falling on one's own sword.\"\n\n4) Polished translation:\n   \"The tortoise is killed by its own sword.\"\n\nThe meaning conveys that a person's downfall often comes from their own actions, words, or creations."
