The proverb implies that every mother (or by extension, every person of significance) has their own identity and reputation in the community - they aren't anonymous or insignificant.\n\nThe term \"\u00c0p\u1ecd\u0301nl\u00e9\" refers to a title of honor or respect, suggesting that calling someone \"Mother of K\u00e1\u00e0\" (using their child's name as a way to identify them) is actually showing them honor rather than diminishing their individual identity.\n\nThe deeper meaning relates to how in traditional Yoruba communities, women may sometimes be known through their children's names (\"Mother of so-and-so\"), but this doesn't mean they lack their own identity or standing. Rather, it's an honorific that recognizes their important role as mothers while acknowledging they have their own reputation and place in society."
