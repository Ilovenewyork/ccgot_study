  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n**Literal translation**: \"One does not worship a deity during a time of scarcity/harmattan; when the time of plenty comes, one will spread out an altar/make offerings.\"\n\n**Meaning**: This proverb advises against making sacrifices or worship only during difficult times. It suggests that true devotion isn't shown only during hardship but should continue (and can be more generous) when prosperity returns.\n\n**Cultural context**: The proverb uses the concept of \"\u1ecd\u0300f\u1ecd\u0301n-\u1ecd\u0300n\" (harmattan - the dry, dusty season) as a metaphor for scarcity or hard times. In Yoruba traditional religion, worship of \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 (deities) often involves offerings. The proverb cautions against being a fair-weather worshipper who only remembers spiritual obligations during difficulties but forgets them in good times.\n\n**Modern application**: This wisdom extends beyond religious practice to relationships and commitments in general - one shouldn't only seek help during hardship but maintain connections and obligations during prosperous times as well."
