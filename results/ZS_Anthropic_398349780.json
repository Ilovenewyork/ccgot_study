  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"A-lu-d\u00f9nd\u00fan k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1rin\" translates to English as:\n\n\"One who beats the dundun drum does not start the song.\"\n\nThis proverb refers to the traditional roles in Yoruba music performance, where the drummer (particularly of the talking drum called dundun) responds to or accompanies the singer rather than initiating the song. In a broader sense, it speaks to understanding one's role in a collective effort or social hierarchy - knowing when to lead and when to follow."
