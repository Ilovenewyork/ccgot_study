  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"P\u00e8\u0323t\u00e8\u0323p\u00e9\u0323t\u00e8\u0323 \u00ccj\u00e8\u1e63\u00e0, \u00f3 ta s\u00e9\u0323ni l\u00e1ra k\u00f2 wo\u0301\u0323n\" can be translated to English as \"The mud of \u00ccj\u00e8\u1e63\u00e0, it splashes on one but does not stain.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis proverb is used to describe situations or people that may seem problematic or troublesome at first glance but ultimately do not cause any lasting harm or damage. The mud (p\u00e8\u0323t\u00e8\u0323p\u00e9\u0323t\u00e8\u0323) is a metaphor for difficulties or challenges that might appear to affect someone negatively. However, just like the mud that splashes but does not stain, these challenges do not leave a lasting impact. It suggests resilience and the ability to withstand temporary setbacks without being adversely affected in the long run."
