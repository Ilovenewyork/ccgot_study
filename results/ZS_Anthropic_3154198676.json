  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"It is fitting for everyone to reduce expenses on indigo dye, but it is not fitting for the dyer.\"\n\nThe proverb uses the metaphor of indigo dye production to convey that while most people should economize on certain things, those who specialize in or depend on those things for their livelihood cannot afford to cut back. It suggests that what may be reasonable economizing for most people could be harmful to those whose profession or expertise is in that specific area."
