The dundun is a traditional Yoruba talking drum, and its player doesn't just strike the drum randomly - they follow established rhythms, patterns, and techniques.\n\nThe deeper meaning suggests that experts in any field don't act arbitrarily or make decisions without foundation. Their actions, though they might seem spontaneous to outsiders, are actually guided by knowledge, experience, and tradition. This proverb emphasizes the importance of proper training, knowledge of conventions, and respect for established practices before one can effectively innovate or perform.\n\nIt's similar to saying that true mastery involves understanding the rules before you can appear to break them effortlessly."
