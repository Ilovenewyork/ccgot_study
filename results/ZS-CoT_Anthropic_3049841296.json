  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down step by step:\n\n1) \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 \u0144g\u00fany\u00e1n\" - This phrase refers to \"if we are pounding/eating pounded yam\"\n   - \"B\u00ed\" means \"if\"\n   - \"a\" means \"we\"\n   - \"b\u00e1\" is a conditional marker\n   - \"\u0144g\u00fany\u00e1n\" means \"pounding/eating pounded yam\" (y\u00e1n is pounded yam, a staple food)\n\n2) \"k\u00f2m\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300 \u00e1 y\u1ecd\" - This indicates \"the knee will show/appear/stick out\"\n   - \"k\u00f2m\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300\" refers to \"knee\"\n   - \"\u00e1 y\u1ecd\" means \"will show/appear/come out\"\n\nThe literal translation is: \"If we are pounding/eating pounded yam, the knee will show.\"\n\nThe figurative meaning: This proverb teaches that when engaged in an important task or activity (like eating a staple food), one's true character or hidden aspects will eventually be revealed. It suggests that through continuous interaction or engagement, people's true nature or intentions will eventually become evident.\n\nIn English, we might express a similar sentiment with phrases like \"Time reveals all things\" or \"True character emerges through action.\""
