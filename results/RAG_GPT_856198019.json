  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 ti m\u1ecd l\u00e0 \u0144d\u00e9; a-l\u00e1\u00ec-l\u00e9\u0323\u1e63in k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e9 wo\u0300\u0323nwo\u0300\u0323n\" can be translated to English as \"We dress according to our knowledge; one without a horse does not reach the destination.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb emphasizes the importance of preparation and resourcefulness. It suggests that one's success or ability to achieve a goal is dependent on the knowledge and resources they possess. Just as one dresses appropriately based on their understanding of the occasion, one must also have the necessary means (like a horse for travel) to reach their desired destination. It highlights the idea that without proper preparation or resources, achieving one's goals can be difficult or impossible."
