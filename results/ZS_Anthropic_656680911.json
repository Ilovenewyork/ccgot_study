  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"An elder who doesn't greet the king is preparing the rope for his own funeral.\"\n\nThis proverb speaks to the importance of respecting authority and traditional hierarchies. It suggests that deliberately failing to show proper respect to those in positions of power (like the \u00c0\u00e0r\u1eb9, a traditional title for a ruler or king) can lead to serious consequences that one brings upon oneself."
