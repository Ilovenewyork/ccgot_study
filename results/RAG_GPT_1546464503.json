  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0\u00ec-k\u00fak\u00fa-joye, \u00f3 s\u00e0n ju, \u201cE\u0323nu\u00f9 mi \u00f2 k\u00e1 \u00ecl\u00fa\u201d l\u1ecd\" can be translated to English as \"Not being appointed to a chieftaincy title is better than saying, 'My mouth cannot encompass the town.'\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb highlights the idea that it is better not to take on a responsibility or position of authority if one is not capable of handling it effectively. The phrase \"E\u0323nu\u00f9 mi \u00f2 k\u00e1 \u00ecl\u00fa\" (My mouth cannot encompass the town) suggests an inability to manage or control the affairs of the community. Therefore, it is preferable to avoid taking on such a role than to accept it and fail to fulfill its duties. The proverb emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's limitations and the wisdom in avoiding situations where one might be overwhelmed or unable to perform adequately."
