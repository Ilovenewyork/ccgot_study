  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Borrowed money doesn't suit one; borrowed trousers don't suit a person; if they don't fit your legs, they become awkward; one's own possession is what suits one.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of self-ownership and the discomfort that comes with borrowing or using things that don't truly belong to you. It uses two parallel examples:\n\n1. Borrowed money doesn't truly complement you\n2. Borrowed trousers that don't fit properly become uncomfortable and awkward\n\nThe deeper meaning is that what truly fits and suits a person is what legitimately belongs to them. Things we borrow, whether material possessions or resources, often come with constraints or discomfort. This proverb teaches self-reliance and cautions against depending on borrowed things, suggesting that true dignity and comfort come from what one can genuinely call their own.\n\nThe proverb speaks to authenticity and self-sufficiency as cultural values in Yoruba wisdom."
