  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\n1) Breaking down the first part: \"K\u00ed \u1eb9r\u00fa m\u1ecd ara \u1eb9\u0300 l\u1eb9\u0301r\u00fa\"\n   - \"K\u00ed\" means \"let\" or \"may\"\n   - \"\u1eb9r\u00fa\" refers to a \"slave\" in traditional Yoruba context\n   - \"m\u1ecd ara \u1eb9\u0300\" means \"know themselves/itself\"\n   - \"l\u1eb9\u0301r\u00fa\" means \"as a slave\"\n   - So this part means: \"Let the slave know themselves as a slave\"\n\n2) The second part: \"k\u00ed \u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300f\u00e0 m\u1ecd ara \u1eb9\u0300 n\u00edw\u1ecd\u0300f\u00e0\"\n   - \"\u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300f\u00e0\" refers to a \"pawn\" or \"indentured servant\" in Yoruba tradition\n   - Similar structure: \"Let the pawn know themselves as a pawn\"\n\n3) The third part: \"k\u00ed \u1ecdm\u1ecdl\u00faw\u00e0b\u00ed m\u1ecd ara \u1eb9\u0300 l\u1eb9\u0301r\u00fa \u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301run \u1ecdba\"\n   - \"\u1ecdm\u1ecdl\u00faw\u00e0b\u00ed\" refers to a well-bred, cultured person with good character\n   - \"l\u1eb9\u0301r\u00fa \u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301run \u1ecdba\" means \"as a servant of God the king\"\n   - So this means: \"Let the person of good character know themselves as a servant of God the king\"\n\nComplete translation:\n\"Let the slave know themselves as a slave; let the pawn know themselves as a pawn; let the person of good character know themselves as a servant of God the king.\"\n\nThe proverb speaks to knowing one's place or position in society and the natural order, with the underlying message that even the most virtuous person should maintain humility as a servant of God."
