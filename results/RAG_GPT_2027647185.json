  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed gbo\u0301\u0323n ju \u1eb9ni t\u00ed a m\u00e1a d\u00cdf\u00e1 f\u00fan\" translates to \"One cannot be wiser than the person for whom If\u00e1 is being consulted.\" \n\nIn Yoruba culture, If\u00e1 is a system of divination and a key component of the Yoruba religion. It involves consulting the oracle to gain insight and guidance on various matters. The proverb suggests that no matter how wise or knowledgeable one may be, they cannot surpass the wisdom or insight that is specifically meant for the person receiving the divination. It emphasizes the idea that certain knowledge or guidance is uniquely tailored to an individual's situation, and it is not for others to claim or understand fully.\n\nThe proverb teaches humility and respect for the personal and unique nature of divine guidance. It reminds people that wisdom is not just about general knowledge but also about understanding and respecting the specific insights meant for others."
