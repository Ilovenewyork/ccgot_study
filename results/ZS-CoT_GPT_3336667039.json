It emphasizes the importance of focusing on what is happening now.\n\n2. **N\u00ed**: This is a verb that can mean \"is\" or \"to be,\" indicating the state or condition of something.\n\nWhen combined, \"\u00ccwo\u0300\u0323s\u00ed n\u00ed\" conveys the idea that the present moment holds significance and should be the focus of attention, rather than dwelling on the past or worrying about the future. This proverb encourages mindfulness and living in the present."
