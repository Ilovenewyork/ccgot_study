It reflects traditional gender roles in Yoruba society where certain responsibilities, particularly those relating to physical confrontations and their aftermath, were considered men's domain. The proverb can be understood as both descriptive (reflecting cultural norms) and prescriptive (advising women to avoid getting entangled in others' conflicts). In a broader sense, it counsels discretion about which problems one takes responsibility for solving.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 establishes gender role context, while Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the wisdom of knowing which situations to avoid.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"Ol\u00f3b\u00ecnrin kan k\u00ec \u00ed pagbo \u00ecja\" translates to \"A woman does not pay for the medicinal herbs used after a fight.\" This proverb advises women not to take responsibility for conflicts they didn't start and reflects traditional Yoruba gender norms. Beyond its gendered context, it contains universal wisdom about discretion and not shouldering the consequences of others' disputes."
