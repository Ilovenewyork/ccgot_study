  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step:\n\n1) \"\u1eb8 f\u00e0 \u00e1 w\u1ecdl\u00e9\" - This phrase means \"Pull it inside\" or \"Draw it in\"\n2) \"l\u00f3 y\u1eb9\" - means \"is appropriate for\" or \"is befitting for\"\n3) \"\u1eb9l\u1eb9\u0301\u1e63in\" - refers to \"the owner of a horse\" or \"horseman\"\n\nPutting these elements together:\n\nThe literal translation would be: \"Pull it inside\" is appropriate for the horseman.\n\nThe meaning of this proverb is that a horseman should bring his horse inside (or to shelter) - suggesting that people should take proper care of their valuable possessions or responsibilities. It emphasizes the importance of protecting what is valuable to you.\n\nIn English, the proverb could be expressed as: \"The horseman ought to bring his horse inside\" or \"A horseman should shelter his horse.\"\n\nThe cultural implication is about responsibility and proper care of one's assets or dependents."
