  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"E\u00e9g\u00fan ju e\u00e9g\u00fan; \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e1 ju \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0; P\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1 l\u00e9 on\u00ed\u1e63\u00e0ng\u00f3 w\u1ecd\u0300gb\u1eb9\u0301.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"Ig\u00fannug\u00fan b\u00e0 l\u00e9 \u00f2r\u00f9l\u00e9; oj\u00fa t\u00f3 il\u00e9 \u00f3 t\u00f3 oko\" translates roughly to \"The vulture perches on the roof; eyes that can see the house can see the farm.\" This suggests a relationship between hierarchy, visibility, and inevitability.\n2. This phrase uses natural imagery (vulture, house, farm) to express a principle about how things that are obvious or powerful cannot be ignored.\n3. The vulture perching on the roof is highly visible and significant - suggesting prominence and unavoidable presence.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests the main proverb may deal with hierarchies of power or visibility, where certain forces or entities dominate others in ways that cannot be avoided or denied.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One masquerade surpasses another masquerade; one deity surpasses another deity; The red cloth (or leopard) forces the Shango devotee into the bush.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The phrase \"E\u00e9g\u00fan \u00f2 na ob\u00ecnrin l\u00e1g\u1ecd\u0300; ob\u00ecnr\u00edn t\u00fa k\u00edj\u00ecp\u00e1 \u00ecd\u00ed-i r\u1eb9\u0300, \u00f3 fi na e\u00e9g\u00fan\" translates to \"The masquerade does not whip a woman in the gathering; the woman untied her wrapper and used it to whip the masquerade.\" \n2. This phrase illustrates that even powerful cultural entities like the e\u00e9g\u00fan (masquerade) have limitations and can be challenged by those presumed weaker (women).\n3. It suggests a subversion of expected power dynamics in Yoruba culture - even sacred figures have vulnerabilities.\n\nInterim Insight: This contextualizes our main proverb by suggesting that hierarchies of power (even spiritual ones) are not absolute. There are circumstances where even the most powerful entities must yield to others or face consequences.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One masquerade surpasses another masquerade; one deity surpasses another deity; The red cloth forces the Shango devotee into the bush.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the relativity of power and authority, even among spiritual beings. In Yoruba cosmology, both e\u00e9g\u00fan (ancestral masquerades) and \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 (deities) exist in hierarchies where some are more powerful than others. The third part refers to how even a Shango devotee (a powerful deity of thunder) can be forced to retreat when confronted with certain symbols or powers (the p\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1 or red cloth, which may represent a competing spiritual force or taboo). \n\n  The proverb teaches humility by reminding us that no matter how powerful someone or something is, there is always something more powerful. Even spiritual authorities have their limitations and must sometimes yield to greater forces. This reflects the Yoruba understanding of a complex, interconnected universe where power is relative rather than absolute.\n\n- References: The vulture imagery in Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the visibility of power hierarchies, while Similar Phrase 2 demonstrates how even sacred institutions have boundaries and can be challenged under certain circumstances.\n\nFinal Answer: This Yoruba proverb illustrates the relativity of power in both spiritual and worldly realms. It reveals that hierarchies exist everywhere\u2014even among masquerades and deities\u2014and reminds us that no one is supreme in all situations. The imagery of a Shango devotee being forced into the bush by a red cloth (p\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1) demonstrates how even powerful figures have their vulnerabilities and must sometimes retreat. The proverb ultimately teaches humility and respect for the complex power dynamics that govern both the spiritual and physical worlds in Yoruba cosmology."
