  "gold": "Destitution does not attach to one at a particular place; suffering does not attack a person at a particular place; if one walks like a wretch into a town, if one looks like a loser when one enters a town, it is with a miserable calabash that the people will offer one water to drink.",
  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Poverty doesn't come from a single place; suffering doesn't affect a person from just one source; if you walk around in poverty, if you enter a town with the face of poverty, they will use any available calabash to fetch water for you to drink.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis Yoruba proverb speaks to how poverty and hardship manifest in one's life and affect how others treat you. The proverb conveys several layers of meaning:\n\n1. **The multi-sourced nature of hardship**: The first part states that poverty and suffering don't come from just one place or cause - they can arise from various circumstances and situations.\n\n2. **Visible poverty affects treatment**: When a person bears the visible marks of poverty (\"the face of poverty\"), they receive inferior treatment from others.\n\n3. **The calabash metaphor**: Being served water with \"any available calabash\" (igb\u00e1-k\u00fagb\u00e1) indicates disrespect - people won't bother to use proper or clean vessels for someone they perceive as poor. They'll use whatever is at hand, perhaps even a calabash normally considered unsuitable.\n\nThe proverb ultimately warns about how society tends to treat the visibly poor with disrespect and carelessness, highlighting the social consequences that accompany material poverty beyond the financial hardship itself."
