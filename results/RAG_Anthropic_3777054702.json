The proverb describes how a bird, despite being able to fly and access many places, cannot reach the water inside a coconut due to the hard shell and narrow opening.\n\nThe deeper meaning relates to natural limitations and boundaries. Some things remain inaccessible to certain people despite their abilities or efforts. It can be used to describe situations where someone is trying to access resources, information, or opportunities that are structurally unavailable to them.\n\nThe proverb teaches about recognizing one's limitations and understanding that some goals may be unattainable due to natural barriers or circumstances beyond one's control, rather than due to lack of effort or ability."
