  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"You feel shame only once; but embarrassment troubles you daily.\"\n\nThe proverb conveys that while the initial experience of shame might be temporary, the ongoing embarrassment or consequences of a shameful action can persist and affect you every day. It suggests that it's better to endure a moment of discomfort (like admitting a mistake or asking for help) than to suffer the prolonged distress that comes from avoiding that initial shame."
