  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00ccwo\u0300\u0323s\u00ed n\u00ed\" can be translated to English as \"It is the present that matters\" or \"The present is what is important.\" \n\n### Explanation:\nThis proverb emphasizes the importance of focusing on the present moment rather than dwelling on the past or worrying excessively about the future. It suggests that what is happening now should be given priority and attention, as it is the only time we can actively influence and make decisions. The proverb encourages mindfulness and the idea that the present is where life unfolds and where opportunities exist."
