  "gen": "# Translation and Interpretation of Yoruba Proverb\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: K\u00ed ni or\u00ed \u0144\u1e63e t\u00ed \u00e8j\u00eck\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u00e8 \u1e63e? \u00c8j\u00eck\u00e1 ru \u1eb9r\u00f9 \u00f3 gba \u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301d\u00fanr\u00fan; or\u00ed ta ti\u1eb9\u0300 n\u00ed og\u00fanl\u00fagba.\n(What can the head do that the shoulders cannot? The shoulders carry loads worth five hundred, while the head sells its own for just twenty.)\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This similar phrase uses body parts (head and shoulders) to discuss relative value and capabilities.\n2. It highlights how one might undervalue their own contributions while overvaluing others.\n3. The numerical comparison (five hundred vs. twenty) creates a stark contrast to illustrate misperception of value.\n4. This suggests our target proverb may similarly involve numerical comparisons and questioning of values or choices.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our target proverb likely contains a rhetorical question that exposes a contradiction or poor judgment in comparing values.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The hunter of game is going hunting, and he asks, 'Is it five hundred game or six hundred game?' Which one did you take from there?\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: W\u00e8r\u00e8 \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n n\u00ed \u0144w\u00edp\u00e9 ir\u00fa \u00f2un \u00f2 s\u00ed; ir\u00fa \u1eb9\u0300\u1eb9\u0301 p\u1ecd\u0300 \u00f3 ju \u1eb9gb\u00e0\u00e1gb\u00e8je l\u1ecd.\n(Only a fool says there is no one like him; his kind are more than thousands upon thousands.)\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase cautions against thinking oneself unique or exceptional when in reality, one is quite ordinary.\n2. It highlights the folly of self-importance and exaggerated self-assessment.\n3. The phrase uses hyperbole (thousands upon thousands) to emphasize the commonness of supposedly unique traits.\n4. Applied to our target proverb, this suggests questioning hypothetical gains when you haven't secured anything tangible yet.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase reinforces that our target proverb likely criticizes counting or valuing something before it's actually obtained, showing presumptuous or foolish thinking.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"The hunter going hunting asks, 'Should I hunt five hundred game or six hundred game?' But which one have you actually caught yet?\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This proverb ridicules those who debate potential future gains or hypothetical choices when they haven't accomplished anything concrete yet. It criticizes counting one's chickens before they hatch. In Yoruba culture, it warns against premature celebration or planning based on presumed success. The hunter who hasn't caught anything yet is foolishly debating how many animals to catch, showing poor judgment and misplaced priorities. The proverb teaches pragmatism and focusing on actual achievements rather than hypothetical scenarios.\n\n- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 demonstrates the theme of misplaced values and incorrect self-assessment. Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the critique of foolish thinking and exaggerated self-importance that appears in the main proverb."
