  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down step by step:\n\n\"K\u00e0k\u00e0 k\u00e1 d\u1ecd\u0300b\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300 f\u00fan G\u00e0m\u0300b\u00e0r\u00ed, k\u00e1 r\u1ecd\u0301j\u00fa k\u00e1 k\u00fa.\"\n\nBreaking down the components:\n- \"K\u00e0k\u00e0\" means \"rather than\" or \"instead of\"\n- \"k\u00e1 d\u1ecd\u0300b\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300\" means \"to prostrate\" or \"to bow down\" (a sign of submission)\n- \"f\u00fan G\u00e0m\u0300b\u00e0r\u00ed\" means \"for the Hausa/northern person\" (Gambari is a term used to refer to Hausa people or northerners)\n- \"k\u00e1 r\u1ecd\u0301j\u00fa\" means \"to be brave\" or \"to endure\"\n- \"k\u00e1 k\u00fa\" means \"to die\"\n\nPutting it together, the literal translation is:\n\"Rather than prostrate for the Hausa man, it's better to be brave and die.\"\n\nThe figurative meaning conveys that it's better to die with dignity than to submit to humiliation or oppression. It expresses the value of maintaining one's honor and self-respect even in the face of death, rather than living in submission."
