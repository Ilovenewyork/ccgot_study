  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 t\u00ed \u00f2 k\u00ed \u00c0\u00e0r\u1eb9 \u0144fi ok\u00f9n sin ara-a r\u00e8\u0323\" translates to \"An elder who does not greet the chief is tying a rope around his own neck.\"\n\nExplanation: In Yoruba culture, greeting is a significant aspect of showing respect, especially towards those in positions of authority or elders. The proverb suggests that an elder who fails to show respect to a leader or someone of higher status is essentially bringing trouble upon themselves. It implies that neglecting to observe social norms and courtesies can lead to negative consequences, as it may be perceived as disrespectful or rebellious. The imagery of \"tying a rope around one's own neck\" emphasizes the self-destructive nature of such behavior."
