  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa w\u1ecd \u1ecdj\u00e0 \u00f3 r\u00ecn gb\u1eb9nd\u1eb9\u0301k\u1eb9 \u1ecd\u0300b\u00fan w\u1ecd \u1ecdj\u00e0 \u00f3 r\u00ecn \u1e63\u00f9\u1eb9\u0300\u1e63\u00f9\u1eb9\u0300; \u1ecd\u0300b\u00f9n n\u00ed \u00f3 ru \u1eb9r\u00f9 af\u00ednj\u00fa rel\u00e9.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Aaka \u00f2 gb\u00e9 \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n; igb\u00f3 n\u00ed \u0144gb\u00e9\" translates to \"The crab doesn't live in the savannah; it lives in the forest/bush.\" This indicates natural habitat and the idea that things have their proper place.\n2. This suggests appearances can be deceiving, and one should pay attention to who actually accomplishes tasks rather than who appears more capable.\n3. The phrase establishes a contrast between two entities (crab and forest) that relates to the contrast in our proverb between \"af\u00ednj\u00fa\" (elegant/fashionable person) and \"\u1ecd\u0300b\u00fan\" (dirty/filthy person).\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests a theme of appearances versus reality, and that one should not judge capabilities based solely on outward appearance.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The elegant/fashionable person enters the market walking majestically, the dirty/filthy person enters the market walking slowly/carefully; it is the dirty person who carries the elegant person's load home.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A gb\u00e9 g\u00e0\u00e1r\u00ec \u1ecdm\u1ecd ewur\u1eb9 \u0144roj\u00fa; k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63e \u1eb9r\u00f9 \u00e0g\u00f9nt\u00e0n\" translates to \"We carry cassava flour and the kid goat is complaining; it is not a sheep's load.\" This suggests someone complaining about a burden that isn't theirs to bear.\n2. The phrase highlights the idea of misplaced complaints or concerns, particularly when someone who isn't doing the actual work is expressing dissatisfaction.\n3. This connects to our proverb by emphasizing the contrast between those who show off (the elegant person) versus those who actually do the work (the dirty person).\n\nInterim Insight: This reinforces the theme that actions and actual contributions matter more than appearances or status. The one who appears less impressive may be the one doing the actual work.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The elegant person enters the market walking majestically, while the dirty person enters the market walking slowly and carefully; yet it is the dirty person who ends up carrying the elegant person's load home.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that appearances can be deceiving. It contrasts the showy, elegant person who displays themselves proudly in public with the humble, perhaps less attractive person who moves more carefully. Despite the elegant person's impressive appearance, it is the unassuming \"dirty\" person who actually does the work and carries the burden. The proverb warns against judging people's worth or capabilities based on their outward appearance or how they present themselves. In Yoruba culture, this reflects values of humility and the importance of actual contribution rather than mere showmanship. It may also critique social hierarchies where those of higher status often rely on the labor of those with lower status.\n\n- References: The proverb connects to Similar Phrase 1 by highlighting the contrast between appearances and reality, and to Similar Phrase 2 by emphasizing that actual work and contribution matter more than status or appearance.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa w\u1ecd \u1ecdj\u00e0 \u00f3 r\u00ecn gb\u1eb9nd\u1eb9\u0301k\u1eb9 \u1ecd\u0300b\u00fan w\u1ecd \u1ecdj\u00e0 \u00f3 r\u00ecn \u1e63\u00f9\u1eb9\u0300\u1e63\u00f9\u1eb9\u0300; \u1ecd\u0300b\u00f9n n\u00ed \u00f3 ru \u1eb9r\u00f9 af\u00ednj\u00fa rel\u00e9\" means \"The elegant person enters the market walking majestically, while the dirty person enters the market walking slowly; yet it is the dirty person who carries the elegant person's load home.\" This Yoruba wisdom teaches that those who make the greatest show of themselves aren't necessarily those who do the actual work. It encourages looking beyond appearances to value people for their real contributions"
