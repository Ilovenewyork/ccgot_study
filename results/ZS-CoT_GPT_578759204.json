  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"Mo d\u00e0gb\u00e0 mo d\u00e0g\u00f3, ar\u00e9 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 \u00f2 t\u00e1n l\u00f3j\u00fa\u00f9 mi\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\"Mo d\u00e0gb\u00e0\"** - This phrase means \"I have grown\" or \"I have matured.\" It indicates that the speaker has gained experience or wisdom over time.\n\n2. **\"mo d\u00e0g\u00f3\"** - This can be interpreted as \"I have become wise\" or \"I have become knowledgeable.\" It suggests that the speaker has not only grown in age but also in understanding and insight.\n\n3. **\"ar\u00e9 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9\"** - \"Ar\u00e9\" means \"friend\" or \"companion,\" and \"\u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9\" means \"child\" or \"youth.\" Together, \"ar\u00e9 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9\" can be understood as \"childhood friends\" or \"youthful companions.\"\n\n4. **\"\u00f2 t\u00e1n l\u00f3j\u00fa\u00f9 mi\"** - \"\u00d2 t\u00e1n\" means \"are not finished\" or \"are not exhausted,\" and \"l\u00f3j\u00fa\u00f9 mi\" means \"in my eyes\" or \"in my view.\" This part of the proverb suggests that the speaker still values or holds onto their youthful friendships or perspectives.\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated to:\n\n\"I have grown and become wise, yet the friendships of my youth are not lost on me.\"\n\nThis proverb emphasizes the idea that even as one matures and gains wisdom, the connections and friendships from one's youth remain significant and cherished."
