  "gen": "# Culturally-Grounded Chain-of-Thought Analysis\n\n## Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"Ta n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9un t\u00e1j\u00e1 \u0144j\u00f9r\u00f9?\"\n\n### Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: Ta n\u00ed \u0144j\u00e1j\u00e1 n\u00ed m\u1ecd\u0301\u1e63\u00e1l\u00e1\u1e63\u00ed?\n\n### Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"Ta n\u00ed \u0144j\u00e1j\u00e1 n\u00ed m\u1ecd\u0301\u1e63\u00e1l\u00e1\u1e63\u00ed?\" translates roughly to \"Who says the dog knows the mosque?\" This is questioning who claims a dog understands sacred spaces.\n2. This phrase, like our proverb, uses a dog (aj\u00e1) as a central figure and questions someone's understanding or behavior in relation to established norms.\n3. Both phrases use the interrogative structure \"Ta n\u00ed...\" (Who says/Who is...) to challenge an assumption.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely questions inappropriate behavior or misunderstanding of proper roles, using the dog as a metaphor for someone who doesn't understand proper boundaries or behaviors.\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Who is eating while the dog is staring/salivating?\"\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00ccw\u00e0 n\u00ed \u0144j\u1ecd on\u00edw\u00e0 l\u00f3j\u00fa.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00ccw\u00e0 n\u00ed \u0144j\u1ecd on\u00edw\u00e0 l\u00f3j\u00fa\" translates to \"Character/behavior is what makes its owner recognizable\" or \"One is known by one's character.\"\n2. This phrase emphasizes how behavior reveals one's true nature and identity in Yoruba culture.\n3. Applied to our proverb, it suggests that the act of eating while a dog stares hungrily reveals something about one's character - specifically, a lack of compassion or consideration.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase helps us understand that the proverb is making a judgment about character - specifically about selfishness, lack of sharing, or insensitivity to others' needs.\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Who eats while a dog watches hungrily?\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes selfishness and insensitivity. In Yoruba culture, sharing food is a fundamental value that demonstrates good character. The proverb uses the imagery of someone eating while a hungry dog looks on longingly to illustrate callousness. It serves as a rhetorical question highlighting the impropriety of enjoying abundance while ignoring others in need. The dog represents any dependent or less fortunate person whose needs are being ignored. This proverb teaches the importance of compassion, sharing resources, and being mindful of others' suffering.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 contributes the dog imagery and questioning structure; Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of character judgment.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"Ta n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9un t\u00e1j\u00e1 \u0144j\u00f9r\u00f9?\" translates to \"Who eats while a dog watches hungrily?\" It criticizes selfishness and lack of compassion by questioning who would be insensitive enough to eat without sharing while someone else (represented by the dog) is obviously hungry. In Yoruba culture, this proverb teaches the moral importance of generosity, sharing, and being attentive to others' needs."
