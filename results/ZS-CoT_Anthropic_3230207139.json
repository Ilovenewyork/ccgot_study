  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step:\n\n1) \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0\" means \"an elder\" or \"an old person\"\n2) \"k\u00ec \u00ed\" is a negative marker meaning \"does not\" or \"will not\"\n3) \"w\u1eb9w\u1ecd\u0301\" refers to \"washing hands\"\n4) \"t\u00e1n\" means \"finish\" or \"complete\"\n5) \"k\u00f3 n\u00ed\" translates to \"and then say\" or \"and then claim\"\n6) \"\u00f2un \u00f3 j\u1eb9 si\" means \"he/she will eat with dirty hands\" or \"he/she will eat without washing\"\n\nPutting it all together, the literal translation would be:\n\"An elder does not finish washing his hands and then say he will eat with dirty hands.\"\n\nThe English equivalent that captures the meaning would be:\n\"An elder doesn't wash his hands thoroughly only to eat with dirty hands.\"\n\nThe proverb's meaning: This speaks to consistency and following through with proper actions. It suggests that once you've started doing something properly (washing hands), you should complete the process correctly (using those clean hands to eat). It emphasizes that especially for elders who should know better, it makes no sense to begin something properly but then abandon proper practices midway."
