  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u1eb8y\u1eb9 t\u00f3 fi ara w\u00e9 ig\u00fan, \u1eb9\u0300h\u00ecn \u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144s\u00f9n.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00d2fin ni y\u00f3 s\u1ecd ara \u1eb9\u0300; \u00ecy\u00e0w\u00f3 t\u00ed \u0144na \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u00ecy\u00e1l\u00e9\" translates to \"The law will speak for itself; a wife who beats her senior wife's child.\"\n2. This phrase implies consequences for those who overstep their boundaries or position within a social hierarchy.\n3. It suggests that pretending to have authority or status that you don't legitimately possess will inevitably lead to natural consequences.\n4. This connects to our proverb as both involve social positioning and pretending to be what one is not.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely addresses consequences of falsely claiming a status or position one doesn't have within a social hierarchy.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind the chicken coop.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0f\u00f2pin\u00e1 t\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 pa f\u00ect\u00edl\u00e0, ara \u1eb9\u0300 ni y\u00f3 pa\" translates to \"The wind that claims it will extinguish the lamp will only destroy itself.\"\n2. This phrase warns against overestimating one's abilities or challenging forces beyond one's capacity.\n3. It suggests that attempting to perform tasks beyond one's natural abilities can lead to self-destruction or failure.\n4. This connects to our proverb about the bird comparing itself to a vulture - both involve pretension and its consequences.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces that our proverb is about the dangers of pretension and attempting to assume a status or role beyond one's natural capacity.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind the chicken coop.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against pretension and attempting to claim a status or position beyond one's true capacity. In Yoruba culture, the vulture (ig\u00fan) is a large, powerful bird with a certain status, while sleeping behind a chicken coop represents a lowly, undignified position. The proverb teaches that those who falsely elevate themselves or pretend to be more important than they are will ultimately find themselves in embarrassing or undignified circumstances. It emphasizes the importance of authenticity and accepting one's true position in life rather than pretending to be something one is not.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 warns about consequences of overstepping social boundaries, while Similar Phrase 2 cautions against challenging forces beyond one's capacity.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8y\u1eb9 t\u00f3 fi ara w\u00e9 ig\u00fan, \u1eb9\u0300h\u00ecn \u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144s\u00f9n\" translates to \"A bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind the chicken coop.\" It teaches that those who pretend to be more important than they truly are will ultimately end up in undignified circumstances. In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb encourages authenticity and self-awareness rather than false pretension or imitation of those with higher status. It reminds us that pretending to be something we are not often leads to embarrassment or failure."
