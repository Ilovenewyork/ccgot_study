  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"E\u0323n\u00ed b\u00e1 d\u1eb9 oj\u00fa-u r\u00e8\u0323 s\u00edl\u00e8\u0323 \u00e1 r\u00edm\u00fa-u r\u00e8\u0323\" translates to \"He who closes his eyes will cover his nose\" in English.\n\nExplanation: This proverb suggests that when someone chooses to ignore or avoid seeing a problem (by closing their eyes), they will eventually have to deal with the consequences (covering their nose, perhaps due to an unpleasant smell). It emphasizes the idea that ignoring issues does not make them go away; instead, it often leads to more significant problems that one will eventually have to confront. The proverb serves as a caution against willful ignorance and encourages proactive engagement with challenges."
