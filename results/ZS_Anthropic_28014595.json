  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb can be translated as:\n\n\"When the household head is misbehaving (or acting foolishly), one reprimands the servant instead.\"\n\nThe proverb speaks to the practice of addressing someone of lower status when you cannot directly confront the person in authority who is actually causing problems. It's similar to the concept of \"shooting the messenger\" or dealing with someone more accessible when the real issue lies with a superior who cannot be easily confronted."
