The first part references how wealthy people (\"ol\u00f3w\u00f3\") tend to socialize with other wealthy or affluent people (\"\u1ecdl\u1ecd\u0301r\u1ecd\u0300\"). The second part reinforces this concept by stating that peers or equals (\"\u1eb9gb\u1eb9\u0301\") play or socialize with their own kind.\n\nThe proverb highlights the social reality that people generally gravitate toward those who share similar status, experiences, or backgrounds. It acknowledges the natural social stratification that occurs in communities and how people seek companionship among those with whom they share commonalities.\n\nThis wisdom teaches about social dynamics and can serve as both an observation of human behavior and a reminder about the importance of finding one's appropriate social circle."
