  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb into English step by step:\n\nFirst, let me analyze the key words:\n- \"\u1eb8y\u1eb9\" = bird\n- \"t\u00f3 fi ara w\u00e9\" = that compares itself to\n- \"ig\u00fan\" = vulture\n- \"\u1eb9\u0300h\u00ecn \u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2\" = behind the chicken coop/hen house\n- \"n\u00ed \u0144s\u00f9n\" = sleeps/will sleep\n\nPutting these elements together:\n\"\u1eb8y\u1eb9 t\u00f3 fi ara w\u00e9 ig\u00fan, \u1eb9\u0300h\u00ecn \u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144s\u00f9n.\"\nTranslates to:\n\"A bird that compares itself to a vulture will end up sleeping behind the chicken coop.\"\n\nThe meaning of this proverb is about appropriate self-assessment and ambition. It warns against pretending to be something you're not or aspiring beyond your capabilities. The vulture soars high in the sky, while the bird that merely pretends to have such status ends up in a humble place (behind the chicken coop).\n\nIn English, we might express a similar sentiment with phrases like \"Don't get too big for your boots\" or \"Know your place.\""
