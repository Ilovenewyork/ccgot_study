  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"When pounding yam, the pestle will eventually come out.\"\n\nThe meaning conveys that any difficult situation or task will eventually come to an end. It's similar to sayings like \"this too shall pass\" or \"every problem has a solution.\" The proverb uses the everyday activity of pounding yam (a staple food) as a metaphor - no matter how many times the pestle goes in, it must eventually come out, suggesting that persistence through challenges will lead to resolution."
