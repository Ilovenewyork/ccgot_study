  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed b\u1ecd \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 l\u00f3j\u00fa \u1ecd\u0300f\u1ecd\u0301n-\u1ecd\u0300n; b\u00f3 b\u00e1 dal\u1eb9\u0301 a m\u00e1a t\u00fa p\u1eb9p\u1eb9.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"A k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00f3rira \u1ecd\u0300f\u1ecd\u0301n-\u1ecd\u0300n k\u00e1 fin\u00e1 b\u1ecd ah\u00e9r\u00e9\" translates roughly to \"One does not hate the harmattan season so much that one sets fire to one's hut.\" This suggests a warning against extreme reactions.\n2. Both phrases mention \"\u1ecd\u0300f\u1ecd\u0301n-\u1ecd\u0300n\" (harmattan), the dry, dusty season in West Africa characterized by harsh conditions.\n3. The main proverb seems to reference making sacrifices to deities (\u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0) during harmattan, suggesting timing or circumstances matter.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase warns against self-destructive reactions to difficult seasons, suggesting our main proverb may also caution against inappropriate timing or excessive actions during challenging periods.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One does not worship/sacrifice to a deity during harmattan; if it reaches the ground, it will scatter everywhere.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Ol\u00f3mele k\u00ec \u00ed s\u1ecd p\u00e9 igi y\u00f3 d\u00e0\u00e1 l\u00f3de l\u1ecd\u0301la\" translates to \"The woodcutter doesn't predict that wood will be scarce in the market tomorrow.\"\n2. This phrase suggests one shouldn't predict scarcity or future difficulties in one's own area of expertise or responsibility.\n3. It carries the notion of not speaking against one's own interests or creating problems through pessimistic predictions.\n\nInterim Insight: This adds the dimension of strategic timing and foresight - just as a woodcutter shouldn't predict wood scarcity (potentially harming his livelihood), one shouldn't perform important ritual actions during unfavorable conditions that would render them ineffective.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"One does not sacrifice to a deity during the harmattan season; if the offering reaches the ground, it will scatter everywhere.\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb teaches the importance of appropriate timing and conditions for significant actions. The harmattan season brings dry, dusty winds that would scatter offerings placed for deities, rendering the sacrifice ineffective or disrespectful. At a deeper level, it advises against pursuing important endeavors during unpropitious times. Just as one wouldn't destroy their home because of harsh weather (Similar Phrase 1), nor should one perform sacred duties when conditions will undermine them. And like the woodcutter who doesn't predict scarcity in his own market (Similar Phrase 2), one should be strategic about when to act, recognizing when conditions are favorable for success rather than setting oneself up for failure. The proverb ultimately counsels patience and wisdom in timing important actions.\n\n- **References:** Similar Phrase 1, Similar Phrase 2"
