  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 ak\u00e0n t\u00f3 k\u00f3 s\u00ed garawa y\u00e8g\u00e8d\u00e8, oj\u00fa t\u00ec \u00ed\" translates to English as:\n\n\"An elderly crab that jumps into a basin suddenly feels embarrassed.\"\n\nThe proverb speaks to the idea that when an elder or respected person does something inappropriate or undignified, they often feel shame afterward. It suggests that those of high status or advanced age should maintain their dignity and not engage in behavior that doesn't befit their position."
