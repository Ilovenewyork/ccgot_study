  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb translates to English as: \"Borrowed clothes do not befit one; borrowed trousers do not suit a person; if it does not trip you, it will make you stumble; what truly suits a person is what belongs to them.\" This proverb emphasizes the value of self-reliance and the idea that what truly fits or benefits a person is what they own or have earned themselves, rather than relying on what is borrowed or not genuinely theirs."
