It suggests that overindulgence or the inability to control one's desires can lead to one's downfall or demise. Each animal mentioned (the monkey, the fly, and the antelope) represents different aspects of life where excess can be harmful. The proverb serves as a warning to practice self-control and moderation in all aspects of life to avoid negative consequences."
