It suggests that we should allow a situation to fully run its course (let the sun set completely) before making final assessments or criticisms.\n\nThe proverb uses the metaphor of the sun setting to represent the natural conclusion of events. \"\u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301j\u1ecd\u0301\" (owner of the day) represents a higher authority or divine power that controls time and circumstances.\n\nThe wisdom here is about:\n1. Avoiding premature judgment\n2. Respecting the natural order of things\n3. Recognizing that time brings clarity and resolution\n\nIn practical terms, this proverb might be used to counsel someone to be patient rather than rushing to blame others or make decisions before a situation has fully developed."
