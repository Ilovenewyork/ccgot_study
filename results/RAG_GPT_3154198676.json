  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00d3 y\u1eb9 \u1eb9ni gbogbo k\u00f3 d\u00ednw\u00f3 ar\u00f3, k\u00f2 y\u1eb9 ato\u0300\u0323o\u0301\u0323l\u00e9\" can be translated to English as \"It is expected of everyone to limp a little, but not of the lazy person.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb highlights the idea that everyone faces challenges or difficulties in life, symbolized by \"limping.\" It is normal and expected for people to encounter obstacles and to show signs of struggle. However, the proverb makes a distinction when it comes to a lazy person (\"ato\u0300\u0323o\u0301\u0323l\u00e9\"). For a lazy person, any sign of struggle or difficulty is not due to genuine effort or hardship but rather a result of their own lack of initiative or diligence. Essentially, the proverb suggests that while everyone may have their burdens, the lazy person cannot use this as an excuse for their lack of progress or success. It emphasizes the importance of effort and the difference between genuine challenges and those that arise from laziness."
