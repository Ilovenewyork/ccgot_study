It suggests that true worth is determined by how others perceive and value you, not by self-proclamation.\n\nThe proverb teaches humility and warns against arrogance. In Yoruba culture, being loved and respected by the community is considered more valuable than self-importance. The person who is genuinely loved doesn't need to boast about their qualities, while the one who brags about being incomparable may not actually be held in high esteem by others.\n\nIt relates to the other proverbs you provided which similarly address social acceptance versus rejection in community contexts."
