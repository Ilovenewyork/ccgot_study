  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \u201cE\u0323 f\u00e0 \u00e1 w\u1ecdl\u00e9\u201d l\u00f3 y\u1eb9 \u1eb9l\u00e9\u0323\u1e63in can be translated to English as \"It is 'pull it inside' that befits the horse owner.\" \n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility and being proactive in managing one's affairs. In the context of a horse owner, \"pull it inside\" suggests the action of bringing the horse into a safe or secure place, which is a responsibility that falls on the owner. It implies that those who own or are in charge of something should take the necessary steps to ensure its well-being and security. The proverb serves as a reminder that ownership or leadership comes with the duty to actively care for and protect what is under one's charge."
