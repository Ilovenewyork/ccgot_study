  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"Wasteful spending doesn't suit a person; wearing oversized trousers doesn't suit someone; if it doesn't fit your legs, it becomes baggy; what belongs to you is what suits you.\"\n\nThe meaning conveys that what truly fits or suits a person is what is rightfully theirs or appropriate for their circumstances. It advises against wasteful spending and pretentiousness, suggesting that one should live within their means and embrace what is genuinely appropriate for them rather than trying to adopt what doesn't suit them."
