It suggests that avoiding inevitable responsibilities only postpones and magnifies the eventual difficulties.\n\n**Application**: This proverb might be used to advise someone who is trying to shirk necessary duties, avoid learning important life skills, or escape the natural consequences of their actions. It teaches that accepting necessary hardship now is better than facing greater suffering later."
