  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:**\n\"Let the slave know themselves as a slave; let the pawn know themselves as a pawn; let the well-behaved person know themselves as God the king's slave.\"\n\n**Meaning:**\nThis proverb speaks about self-awareness and understanding one's position in society. It emphasizes that everyone, regardless of social status, should recognize their true place:\n\n1. The slave should acknowledge their status as a slave\n2. The pawn (someone working to pay off a debt) should recognize their position\n3. Even a person of good character (\u1ecdm\u1ecdl\u00faw\u00e0b\u00ed) should humble themselves as a servant of God\n\n**Cultural context:**\nIn traditional Yoruba society, this proverb teaches humility and self-awareness. It suggests that regardless of social standing, everyone ultimately answers to a higher power. The well-mannered person's acknowledgment of being \"God's slave\" shows that even respected individuals should remain humble.\n\nThe proverb encourages people to understand their roles and limitations, avoid arrogance, and recognize that we all serve something greater than ourselves. It's about maintaining proper perspective about one's place in the social and spiritual order."
