  "gen": "# Translation of \"Al\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd-kan k\u00ec \u00ed n\u00e1 \u00e0n\u00e1r\u1eb9\"\n\n**Literal translation:** \"A person with only one cloth does not hang it out to dry in the dew/early morning.\"\n\n**Meaning:** This Yoruba proverb teaches about resource management and caution when you have limited resources. When someone only owns a single piece of clothing, they cannot afford to leave it exposed to the early morning dew to dry, as they would have nothing else to wear in the meantime.\n\n**Explanation:** This proverb emphasizes the need for prudence when dealing with limited resources. It advises against risking your only valuable possession or option. In Yoruba culture, this proverb counsels people to be careful with their limited resources and not to take unnecessary risks when they don't have alternatives or backups.\n\nThe proverb is similar to #2 in your list, which likely warns against playing in the rain when you only have one set of clothes, following the same principle of protecting limited resources."
