  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00d2k\u00f9nk\u00f9n \u00f2 m\u1eb9ni \u1ecd\u0300w\u1ecd\u0300; \u00f3 d\u00cdf\u00e1 f\u00fan \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1 n\u00ecy\u1eb9n\"?\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00d2ru \u00f2 mol\u00f3w\u00f3\" translates to \"The night/darkness does not recognize a person of status/wealth.\"\n2. Both phrases deal with darkness (\"\u00f2k\u00f9nk\u00f9n\" and \"\u00f2ru\") not recognizing or respecting human hierarchies.\n3. \"nIf\u00e1 t\u00ed \u00e0 \u0144d\u00e1 f\u00fan '\u00ccw\u1ecd ta n\u00ecy\u1eb9n?'\" refers to casting If\u00e1 divination for \"Who are you?\" - suggesting someone demanding recognition.\n4. The proverb appears to be addressing arrogance or demands for special treatment in circumstances where status doesn't matter.\n\nInterim Insight: This proverb likely speaks to how natural forces or certain circumstances don't discriminate based on social status or wealth - darkness treats everyone equally regardless of their importance.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Darkness does not recognize a person of respect/honor; it casts If\u00e1 divination for 'Who exactly are you?'\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The second similar phrase \"Orog\u00fan \u00ecy\u00e1 \u1eb9-\u1eb9\u0301 d\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd f\u00fan \u1ecd o n\u00ed k\u00f2 bal\u1eb9\u0300; m\u00e9l\u00f2\u00f3 n\u00ecy\u00e1 \u1eb9-\u1eb9\u0301 d\u00e1 f\u00fan \u1ecd t\u00f3 fi k\u00fa?\" translates roughly to \"Your stepmother makes clothes for you and you complain they don't fit well; how many did your (deceased) mother make for you before she died?\"\n2. This phrase speaks to ingratitude and entitlement - complaining about imperfect gifts while not acknowledging one's true situation.\n3. This adds depth to our original proverb by suggesting it's about people who demand special treatment or recognition in situations where they don't deserve it.\n4. Both proverbs employ rhetorical questions to challenge someone's perspective.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb uses darkness as a metaphor for impartial forces that don't care about human status, and mocks those who still demand special recognition in such circumstances.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"Darkness does not recognize a person of honor; it asks divination for 'Who exactly are you?'\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb teaches that certain forces and situations in life (symbolized by darkness) are impartial and do not respect human hierarchies, status, or wealth. It mocks those who expect special treatment in circumstances where everyone is treated equally. The proverb serves as a humbling reminder that nature and many of life's circumstances do not discriminate based on who we think we are - challenging human arrogance and entitlement. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would be used to caution someone against expecting preferential treatment in situations where everyone faces the same challenges.\n\n- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of darkness as an equalizing force that ignores status. Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of entitlement and ingratitude that makes the cautionary message of the original proverb clearer."
