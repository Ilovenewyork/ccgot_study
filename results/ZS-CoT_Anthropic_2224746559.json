  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll analyze its components and cultural context.\n\nStep 1: Breaking down the proverb's parts:\n- \"A k\u00ec \u00ed\" = One does not/should not\n- \"b\u00e1 \u1ecdba p\u00e0l\u00e0\" = share boundaries/land with the king\n- \"k\u00ed \u1ecdk\u1ecd\u0301 \u1ecdba\" = without the king's hoe/farm tool\n- \"m\u00e1 \u1e63\u00e0n-\u00e1nni l\u1eb9\u0301s\u1eb9\u0300\" = striking/hitting one's foot\n\nStep 2: Understanding the literal meaning:\nThe proverb literally says \"One should not share boundaries with the king without the king's hoe striking one's foot.\"\n\nStep 3: Interpreting the cultural meaning:\nThis proverb speaks to power dynamics and proximity to authority. It suggests that if you live close to or associate with powerful people (the king), you will inevitably experience some consequences or interference from their authority (the king's hoe hitting your foot).\n\nStep 4: Finding an English equivalent:\nThe English translation would be:\n\"If you share a boundary with the king, his hoe will surely strike your foot.\"\n\nThe deeper meaning: When you associate closely with powerful people or authorities, you cannot avoid being affected by their influence or power, sometimes negatively."
