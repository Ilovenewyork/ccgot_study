  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the words:\n- \"B\u00ed\" means \"if\" or \"when\"\n- \"\u00ecl\u00e0r\u00ed\" refers to the \"palace attendant\" or \"royal servant\" (specifically a high-ranking servant in Yoruba kingdoms)\n- \"b\u00e1 f\u1eb9\u0301\" means \"wants to\" or \"desires to\"\n- \"t\u1eb9\u0301\" means \"to dethrone\" or \"to bring down\"\n- \"a n\u00ed\" means \"one asks\" or \"people say\"\n- \"k\u00ed\" means \"what\"\n- \"l\u1ecdba\" or \"l'\u1ecdba\" means \"the king\"\n- \"\u00f3 \u1e63e\" means \"should do\" or \"can do\"\n\nPutting it together, the literal translation is:\n\"If/when the palace attendant wants to dethrone (the king), one asks what can the king do?\"\n\nThe English equivalent would be:\n\"When a royal servant wants to overthrow the king, what can the king do about it?\"\n\nThis proverb speaks to the vulnerability of leaders to betrayal from those closest to them. It suggests that when someone from within your trusted circle decides to betray you, it can be particularly dangerous and difficult to defend against."
