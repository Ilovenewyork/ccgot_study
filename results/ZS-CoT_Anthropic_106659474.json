  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, let me identify the key words and phrases:\n- \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa\" refers to someone who is elegant, stylish, or fashionable\n- \"w\u1ecd \u1ecdj\u00e0\" means \"enters the market\"\n- \"\u00f3 r\u00ecn gb\u1eb9nd\u1eb9\u0301k\u1eb9\" describes walking in a proud, swaggering manner\n- \"\u1ecd\u0300b\u00fan/\u1ecd\u0300b\u00f9n\" refers to a dirty or filthy person\n- \"\u00f3 r\u00ecn \u1e63\u00f9\u1eb9\u0300\u1e63\u00f9\u1eb9\u0300\" describes walking slowly or carefully\n- \"ru \u1eb9r\u00f9\" means \"carries the load\"\n- \"rel\u00e9\" means \"home\" or \"to the house\"\n\nThe proverb contrasts two people:\n1. The elegant person who enters the market walking proudly\n2. The dirty/filthy person who enters the market walking carefully/slowly\n\nThe twist comes at the end: \"\u1ecd\u0300b\u00f9n n\u00ed \u00f3 ru \u1eb9r\u00f9 af\u00ednj\u00fa rel\u00e9\" - it is the dirty person who ends up carrying the elegant person's load home.\n\nComplete English translation:\n\"The elegant person enters the market walking proudly, the dirty person enters the market walking carefully; yet it is the dirty person who carries the elegant person's load home.\"\n\nThe meaning suggests that appearances can be deceiving, and those who appear humble or lowly often do the real work, while those who show off may not be as productive or helpful as they appear."
