  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"A dog does not go into the deep forest to hunt a leopard/tiger.\"\n\nThis proverb essentially warns against taking on challenges or opponents that are far beyond one's capabilities. It advises people to recognize their limitations and not engage in situations where they are clearly outmatched or where the risk is too great for their abilities."
