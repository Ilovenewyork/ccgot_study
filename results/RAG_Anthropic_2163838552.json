The proverb captures the arrogance and misplaced confidence of someone who challenges authority despite their lower position.\n\nIn Yoruba culture, the king has ultimate power and authority, while palace servants are expected to be obedient and respectful. When a servant becomes rebellious and questions what consequences the king could possibly impose, it demonstrates foolish defiance because the king has numerous ways to discipline or punish disobedient subjects.\n\nThe proverb is used to caution against challenging those who have authority over you, and serves as a warning about the consequences of insubordination or forgetting one's place in a hierarchical structure."
