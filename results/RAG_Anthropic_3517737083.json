  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal Translation:**\n\"After saying twenty, after saying thirty, 'I don't want it, I don't accept it' is how a fool ends a matter.\"\n\n**Meaning:**\nThis proverb criticizes stubbornness and unreasonable rejection of good advice or negotiations. It suggests that when wise counsel is given repeatedly (symbolized by counting \"twenty\" and \"thirty\" - representing multiple attempts at persuasion), only a foolish person abruptly ends the discussion with outright rejection (\"I don't want it, I don't accept it\").\n\n**Cultural Context:**\nIn Yoruba culture, elders and wise people are expected to discuss matters thoroughly, considering different perspectives before reaching a conclusion. This proverb highlights the value placed on patience, listening, and thoughtful consideration in decision-making processes.\n\n**Application:**\nThe proverb is used to caution against hasty dismissal of advice or opportunities without proper consideration. It teaches that wisdom involves listening to multiple viewpoints before making decisions, rather than stubbornly refusing to engage with suggestions or proposals."
