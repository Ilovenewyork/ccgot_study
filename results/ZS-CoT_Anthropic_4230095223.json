It suggests that if you only look at things from your own limited perspective, you'll only see what's immediately apparent to you, missing the bigger picture.\n\nEnglish translation: \"Whoever looks down will see their nose.\"\n\nEquivalent meaning: \"If you only look inward, you'll only see yourself,\" suggesting that a narrow focus leads to limited understanding."
