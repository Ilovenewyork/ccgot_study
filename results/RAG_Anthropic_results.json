It points out the contradiction of someone who has never experienced wealth or honor (oj\u00fa \u00f2 r\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e1 r\u00ed) yet names their child \"\u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" (meaning \"wealth/honor is sweet\"). \n\n**Deeper Explanation**: The proverb criticizes people who praise or glorify things they have never personally experienced. It highlights the irony of speaking authoritatively about something one doesn't truly know. In Yoruba culture, naming is significant and often reflects aspirations or circumstances, so naming a child \"Wealth is sweet\" when you've never had wealth shows either hopeful aspiration or pretension.\n\nThis proverb serves as a caution against pretending to have knowledge about experiences one hasn't actually had, or speaking with authority about unfamiliar situations."

It suggests that every person has their natural capacity or limit, just as a trap must be proportional to the rat it aims to catch, and a cat will not attempt to carry what is beyond its strength.\n\n**Cultural explanation:** In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and recognizing one's boundaries. It counsels against attempting tasks beyond one's abilities or means. The imagery of the rat trap needing to match the rat's size, and the cat knowing not to attempt carrying excessive loads, illustrates how nature itself demonstrates the principle of operating within one's capacity.\n\nThis proverb would be used to advise someone to be realistic about their abilities, to avoid overreaching, and to understand that success comes from working within one's natural capabilities rather than attempting the impossible."

The vulture (ig\u00fan) is a powerful bird that soars high and has a certain status, while the bird that merely pretends to be like a vulture lacks the actual capabilities and ends up in a lowly position - sleeping behind the chicken coop (\u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2).\n\nThe proverb teaches that pretending to be something you're not or comparing yourself to those far above your station without having the necessary qualities or abilities will only lead to disappointment and possibly humiliation. It encourages people to be authentic and to develop themselves genuinely rather than merely imitating others or putting on airs.\n\nThis wisdom applies to situations where people try to claim status, importance, or abilities they haven't earned or don't possess."

Among masquerades (e\u00e9g\u00fan), some are more powerful than others\n2. Among deities (\u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e1), some rank higher than others\n3. Even a Sango worshipper (on\u00ed\u1e63\u00e0ng\u00f3), who serves the powerful deity of thunder, will flee into the bush when confronted by a leopard (p\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1)\n\nThe deeper meaning teaches humility and warns against overconfidence. No matter how powerful or important one might be in their sphere, there is always someone or something more powerful. Even those who draw their identity from powerful associations (like the Sango worshipper) will find themselves humbled when confronted with a superior force (the leopard).\n\nThis proverb is often used to counsel people against excessive pride or to remind someone that power is always relative, not absolute."

It portrays someone eating alone while making excuses like \"I am full\" or \"I refuse\" to avoid sharing food with others.\n\nIn Yoruba culture, sharing food is a fundamental social value that demonstrates generosity and community spirit. The proverb condemns those who eat in isolation and use false excuses to avoid sharing with others. The reference to an elderly person (\u00e0gb\u00e0) makes the criticism more pointed, as elders are expected to model proper behavior in the community.\n\nThis proverb would typically be used to admonish someone who is being selfish with their resources or to warn against the social consequences of greed and self-centeredness."

It suggests that we flourish in the environments, relationships, or endeavors where we commit our energy, attention, and efforts.\n\nThe proverb uses the metaphor of the physical body to represent one's whole self - including effort, attention, and commitment. It teaches that genuine dedication to a place, relationship, or pursuit leads to growth and prosperity there.\n\nIn practical terms, this wisdom applies to many aspects of life:\n- A business thrives where you invest your time and resources\n- Relationships flourish when you give them genuine attention\n- Skills develop where you focus your practice\n\nThis reflects the universal principle that meaningful growth comes from purposeful investment of oneself."

The proverb captures the arrogance and misplaced confidence of someone who challenges authority despite their lower position.\n\nIn Yoruba culture, the king has ultimate power and authority, while palace servants are expected to be obedient and respectful. When a servant becomes rebellious and questions what consequences the king could possibly impose, it demonstrates foolish defiance because the king has numerous ways to discipline or punish disobedient subjects.\n\nThe proverb is used to caution against challenging those who have authority over you, and serves as a warning about the consequences of insubordination or forgetting one's place in a hierarchical structure."

The only foods a slave cannot access are those that are not even available for sale in the marketplace.\n\n**Deeper explanation:** \nThis proverb speaks to the limited restrictions on what enslaved people could consume in traditional Yoruba society. While slaves had a lower social status, their basic needs like food were generally met with whatever was commonly available. The proverb ironically highlights that slaves weren't restricted from common foods - only from things so rare or precious that they couldn't even be found in the marketplace.\n\nIn contemporary usage, this proverb can be applied to situations where people claim they're being denied something that isn't actually available to anyone. It reminds us that some limitations affect everyone equally, not just those in disadvantaged positions."

Those in positions of power shouldn't expect those beneath them to do work that they themselves should be doing\n2. One shouldn't depend on a subordinate or someone in a weaker position to fulfill one's responsibilities\n3. It's inappropriate to shift your duties to those who should be under your protection\n\nThis is similar to saying \"the boss shouldn't rely on the employee to do the boss's job\" or warning against role reversal where the powerful expect service from the vulnerable."

This proverb highlights the value placed on patience, listening, and thoughtful consideration in decision-making processes.\n\n**Application:**\nThe proverb is used to caution against hasty dismissal of advice or opportunities without proper consideration.

It suggests that true worth is determined by how others perceive and value you, not by self-proclamation.\n\nThe proverb teaches humility and warns against arrogance. In Yoruba culture, being loved and respected by the community is considered more valuable than self-importance. The person who is genuinely loved doesn't need to boast about their qualities, while the one who brags about being incomparable may not actually be held in high esteem by others.\n\nIt relates to the other proverbs you provided which similarly address social acceptance versus rejection in community contexts."

The proverb emphasizes that despite appearances or claims of power, one cannot prevent what is inevitable or stop someone more powerful from their chosen path.\n\nThe second part reinforces this by suggesting that if the vine attempts to prevent the elephant from going to a specific place (Alo), the vine will actually be dragged along with the elephant - meaning that not only will the attempt fail, but the one trying to obstruct will be carried along by the force they tried to resist.\n\nThis proverb teaches about recognizing power dynamics and the futility of opposing forces much greater than oneself. It counsels humility and wisdom in choosing one's battles, particularly against those with significantly more power or authority."

It's used to emphasize that actions have natural consequences that must be accepted. Just as you cannot pound yam without the up-and-down motion of the pestle, you cannot engage in certain activities without experiencing their inherent effects.\n\nIn practical application, this proverb might be used to counsel someone to accept the challenges or difficulties that naturally come with their chosen path or undertaking."

The proverb describes a child who has never seen soup (the proper use of palm oil) yet uses the precious palm oil merely to rub on their chest (a wasteful misuse).\n\nThe proverb is used to criticize people who misapply valuable resources or opportunities because they lack understanding or experience.

When a small force tries to restrict a much greater force, the result is that the restraint simply gets carried along with the greater power.\n\n**Cultural Context:**\nThe proverb uses imagery familiar in Yoruba culture - the tall palm tree (\u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9), the mighty elephant (erin), and the \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n tree. It contrasts the seemingly impressive height of a chain with the much greater power of an elephant, showing that even what appears substantial (a chain as tall as a palm tree) is inadequate against true strength.\n\n**Application:**\nThis proverb is used to caution against attempting to control forces beyond one's capacity. It can apply to situations where:\n- Someone tries to restrict a person with much greater influence or power\n- A weak policy or rule is applied to a strong-willed individual\n- Any attempt to limit something using inadequate means\n\nThe wisdom advises understanding the true measure of forces at play before attempting restraint."

Moths often fly toward flames or bright lights and can get burned or killed as a result. \n\nThe proverb warns against overestimating one's abilities or challenging forces far greater than oneself. It suggests that when someone threatens to destroy or overcome something that is inherently more powerful than they are, they will likely end up harming themselves instead.\n\nIn broader cultural context, this proverb teaches humility and caution, warning against hubris or taking on challenges beyond one's capacity. It's a reminder that sometimes our own aggression or overconfidence can lead to our downfall, especially when we fail to recognize the true power of what we're confronting."

The image is vivid - a mature crab (representing an elder) crawling among bananas (an unfitting place) creates a sense of misplacement and impropriety.\n\nIn Yoruba culture, elders are expected to maintain dignity and serve as examples of proper conduct. When they engage in behavior unbecoming of their status or age, it brings shame not only to themselves but potentially to the community.\n\nThe proverb teaches that with age and status comes responsibility to behave appropriately. It serves as a warning that one's actions should align with one's position in society, especially as one grows older and more respected."

The rhetorical question at the end (\"are you the one who swallowed it?\") emphasizes the absurdity of not appreciating such a significant title.\n\nThe proverb teaches that one should appreciate and be grateful for honors, compliments, or prestigious associations rather than showing indifference or ingratitude. It encourages people to recognize and value their positive connections and heritage."

It acknowledges the natural social stratification that occurs in communities and how people seek companionship among those with whom they share commonalities.\n\nThis wisdom teaches about social dynamics and can serve as both an observation of human behavior and a reminder about the importance of finding one's appropriate social circle."

The well-mannered person's acknowledgment of being \"God's slave\" shows that even respected individuals should remain humble.\n\nThe proverb encourages people to understand their roles and limitations, avoid arrogance, and recognize that we all serve something greater than ourselves.

In this relationship, while the diviner has knowledge, they shouldn't be condescending or think themselves intellectually superior to their client.\n\nThe deeper wisdom is about humility in advisory roles - whether as a counselor, teacher, or guide. It reminds us that providing guidance requires respect and acknowledging that the person seeking help has their own wisdom and agency in applying the advice they receive.\n\nThis proverb teaches the importance of respectful counsel without presuming to know better than those we serve."

It teaches about the human tendency to focus on distant problems while ignoring similar issues closer to home.\n\nThis reflects the universal wisdom about people often being more interested in distant matters than addressing immediate concerns in their own surroundings - similar to the English saying \"The grass is always greener on the other side.\""

The proverb suggests that when a person becomes so confident that they believe they have nothing more to learn (\"I know it all\"), they become vulnerable to spiritual dangers or misfortune (symbolized by being carried away by Oro).\n\nThe deeper meaning conveys that excessive pride in one's knowledge often precedes a fall. It warns against intellectual arrogance and encourages humility and continued learning.

Rather, it's an honorific that recognizes their important role as mothers while acknowledging they have their own reputation and place in society."

This proverb teaches self-reliance and cautions against depending on borrowed things, suggesting that true dignity and comfort come from what one can genuinely call their own.\n\nThe proverb speaks to authenticity and self-sufficiency as cultural values in Yoruba wisdom."

The proverb is essentially asking: how can someone claim to have lost something if it's not clear they ever had it in the first place?\n\nThe proverb is used to challenge people who exaggerate their losses or complain about being deprived of things they never truly possessed. It's a way of questioning the credibility of someone's claims of victimhood or loss.\n\nThis is similar to proverb #2 in your list which expresses the same concept with slightly different wording. Both proverbs use the character \"Daaro\" as a rhetorical device to convey skepticism about unverified claims of loss.\n\nThe proverb teaches the importance of honesty and warns against false claims or exaggeration of one's possessions or losses."

The person is talking about how many pigs they'll buy (asking whether there are 500 or 600 pigs available), yet they haven't even purchased a single one.\n\nThe proverb mocks those who count their chickens before they hatch or who pretend to be knowledgeable about matters they have no real experience with. The final question \"which one did you take from there?\" highlights the irony - the person hasn't taken any pigs at all, making their detailed questions about quantities meaningless.\n\nIt serves as a warning against premature boasting or speculation before actually achieving something concrete."

It suggests that no matter how financially desperate the head of a household becomes, certain tasks beneath their status (like sweeping the ground with bare hands rather than using a proper broom) remain inappropriate for them.\n\nThe proverb emphasizes the cultural understanding of maintaining social hierarchy and appropriate roles even during hardship. It relates to the concept of dignity in leadership positions and the importance of maintaining one's position and respect in the community despite challenges.\n\nThe other proverbs you shared follow a similar pattern, suggesting that no matter how desperate a diviner becomes, they shouldn't ask about yesterday's sacrifice, and no matter how hungry a monkey gets, it shouldn't eat dirt."

The dramatic person expends so much energy on emotional displays that they actually end up in a position of providing for or working to benefit the calmer person.\n\nIt teaches that excessive emotional reactions often lead to disadvantageous positions, while those who control their temper tend to benefit.

In Yoruba traditional religion, worship of \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 (deities) often involves offerings. The proverb cautions against being a fair-weather worshipper who only remembers spiritual obligations during difficulties but forgets them in good times.\n\n**Modern application**: This wisdom extends beyond religious practice to relationships and commitments in general - one shouldn't only seek help during hardship but maintain connections and obligations during prosperous times as well."

In Yoruba culture, showing moderation, self-control, and proper etiquette during meals reflects good upbringing and character.\n\nThe proverb serves as a reminder that how we eat reflects our inner character and upbringing, encouraging people to practice restraint and proper manners."

In the dark, everyone is treated the same way, with the question \"Who are you?\" being asked of everyone regardless of their standing.\n\n**Cultural context:** The proverb uses imagery from Ifa divination (a traditional Yoruba spiritual practice) to illustrate how darkness levels all social distinctions. The mention of \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1 n\u00ecy\u1eb9n\" (Who are you?) indicates that in darkness, even important people must identify themselves since they cannot be recognized by sight.\n\n**Application:** This proverb is used to emphasize that certain circumstances (like darkness) are great equalizers that don't respect rank, wealth, or status. It can be used to remind people that in some situations, everyone faces the same challenges regardless of their position in society.\n\nThe other proverbs you provided express similar sentiments about equality in certain circumstances or questioning assumptions about who truly cares for you."

It means that when a wife truly understands her husband - his moods, preferences, character, and ways - there's no need for outside intervention or mediation in their affairs.\n\nThe proverb uses \"moj\u00fa\" (knows the face) metaphorically to represent deep understanding beyond just physical recognition. When spouses develop this level of understanding, third parties (\"al\u00e1r\u00ecnn\u00e0\" - the mediator or go-between) naturally become unnecessary and should withdraw (\"y\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300\" - step aside).\n\nThis wisdom highlights the importance of direct communication and understanding between couples, suggesting that intimate knowledge of one another eliminates the need for intermediaries and strengthens the marital bond."

When someone is constantly being carried (metaphorically) or overly assisted, they never develop their own capabilities or self-reliance. In the long run, this excessive dependence becomes harmful to the person themselves.\n\nThe proverb warns against creating situations where people become too dependent on help, as this ultimately prevents their personal growth and self-sufficiency. It encourages allowing people to develop their own skills and resilience by not doing everything for them.\n\nThis wisdom applies to many contexts - from parenting (where overprotection harms a child's development), to workplace mentoring, to community support systems, where the goal should be empowerment rather than creating dependency."

The buttocks, by their natural design, maintain their shape regardless of how long or how often one sits. They don't flatten permanently despite constant pressure.\n\nThe proverb metaphorically means that some things retain their essential nature despite external pressures. It speaks to natural resilience and the idea that certain fundamental characteristics cannot be permanently altered.\n\nIn practical application, this proverb might be used to:\n- Suggest that people's true character or nature will eventually reveal itself\n- Indicate that some problems or issues will persist despite attempts to suppress them\n- Emphasize that some traditions or cultural practices endure despite modernization\n- Remind people that certain realities cannot be changed no matter how much one tries\n\nThe proverb shares meaning with the others you listed which appear to deal with permanence, proper positioning, and respect for natural order."

The person who owns beads is using them to bundle things together because that's what they have available. However, if they had money (better resources), they wouldn't resort to using their valuable beads for such a mundane purpose.\n\nThe deeper meaning teaches about:\n1. Making the best of limited resources\n2. Using what you have at hand when necessary, even if it's not the optimal solution\n3. The irony that sometimes people must use their valuables for practical purposes because they lack alternatives\n\nThis proverb reflects the Yoruba philosophy of resourcefulness and adaptation while acknowledging the constraints people face in challenging circumstances."

Building (or preparing) according to what you know or have\n2. The contrast of someone without a horse trying to arrive with the grandiosity of someone who has one\n\nIn Yoruba culture, this proverb counsels humility and self-awareness. It suggests that pretending to have more status or ability than you actually possess is foolish. One should acknowledge their limitations rather than putting on airs. This doesn't mean one shouldn't aspire to improve, but rather that one should be honest about their current position.\n\nThe proverb encourages authenticity and discourages pretentiousness or living beyond one's means."

In Yoruba culture, this reflects the importance of respectful communication and taking responsibility for one's words.\n\nThe essential wisdom here is that self-awareness should lead to better behavior, not serve as an excuse for poor behavior.

It highlights the interconnected nature of power structures and how confronting the leader often means dealing with their entire support system.\n\nIn contemporary contexts, this proverb might apply to situations like confronting a boss and then experiencing coldness from colleagues, or criticizing a community leader and finding yourself ostracized by community members.\n\nThe wisdom here is about understanding the full consequences of your actions when challenging established power."

Just as a chicken shouldn't approach an elder's face to peck at mucus, junior members of society shouldn't overstep their boundaries when dealing with elders or authority figures, even when they notice something wrong.\n\nThe underlying wisdom is about knowing one's place in social interactions and understanding that certain issues should be addressed by peers or those of equal status, not by subordinates."

When an elder seems hesitant or overly careful in addressing an issue, it's not cowardice but wisdom born from experience. They understand the potential consequences of hasty actions and know that some battles are not worth fighting if they threaten one's wellbeing or life.\n\nIn Yoruba society, this proverb might be used to explain why elders often counsel patience, moderation, and careful consideration rather than impulsive action or confrontation."

The proverb conveys several layers of meaning:\n\n1. **The multi-sourced nature of hardship**: The first part states that poverty and suffering don't come from just one place or cause - they can arise from various circumstances and situations.\n\n2. **Visible poverty affects treatment**: When a person bears the visible marks of poverty (\"the face of poverty\"), they receive inferior treatment from others.\n\n3. **The calabash metaphor**: Being served water with \"any available calabash\" (igb\u00e1-k\u00fagb\u00e1) indicates disrespect - people won't bother to use proper or clean vessels for someone they perceive as poor. They'll use whatever is at hand, perhaps even a calabash normally considered unsuitable.\n\nThe proverb ultimately warns about how society tends to treat the visibly poor with disrespect and carelessness, highlighting the social consequences that accompany material poverty beyond the financial hardship itself."

While women might participate in mediation processes, the final resolution was traditionally seen as the domain of male elders or leaders.\n\nThis proverb is one of many in Yoruba culture that reflects historical gender dynamics and role expectations, though modern interpretations and applications would certainly differ as social norms have evolved."
