It's a commentary on empty boasting or misplaced confidence, especially when someone claims they can lead or accomplish something beyond their actual capacity.\n\nThe proverb teaches discernment in choosing whom to follow or trust, warning against being deceived by those who overstate their abilities but cannot actually deliver on their promises."
