When the head of the household (ba\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300) is in a celebratory mood or dancing (t\u00e0k\u00ect\u00ec), it suggests they're not in the right frame of mind for serious discussions. In such moments, you might as well talk to the house post (\u00f2r\u00f3gi) rather than trying to engage them in important matters.\n\nThe proverb teaches wisdom about:\n1. Understanding appropriate timing for important conversations\n2. Recognizing when authority figures are not receptive to serious matters\n3. The futility of trying to discuss important issues with someone who is distracted or in a different mental state\n\nIt reflects the Yoruba cultural value of respecting proper context and timing for different types of interactions, especially when dealing with authority figures."
