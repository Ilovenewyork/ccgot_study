  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to:\n\n\"I am full\" means \"I am full,\" \"I refuse\" means \"I refuse\"; eating and still wanting more is the behavior of a greedy elder.\n\nThe proverb essentially warns against greed and gluttony. It suggests that an honest person admits when they've had enough (saying \"I am full\" when truly full), while a greedy person continues to want more even after being satisfied. It criticizes those who cannot be content with what they have received."
