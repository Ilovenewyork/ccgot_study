  "gen": "# Translation and Interpretation of Yoruba Proverb\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u00cc\u1e63\u1eb9\u0300 \u00f2 ti ib\u00eckan m\u00fa \u1eb9ni; \u00ecy\u00e0 \u00f2 tib\u00eckan j\u1eb9 \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n; b\u00ed o b\u00e1 r\u00ecnr\u00ecn \u00f2\u1e63\u00ec, b\u00ed o b\u00e1 oj\u00fa \u00ec\u1e63\u1eb9\u0301 w\u1ecd\u0300l\u00fa, igb\u00e1-k\u00fagb\u00e1 ni w\u1ecdn \u00f3 fi bu omi f\u00fan \u1eb9 mu.\n(Translation: Poverty doesn't originate from one place; suffering doesn't come from one source; if you walk in poverty, if you enter a town in a state of destitution, they will give you water to drink in any available container.)\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase speaks about how one's condition follows them regardless of location - poverty isn't tied to geography but to circumstance.\n2. It suggests that one's status determines how they're treated in society - a poor person will be served water in whatever container is available, indicating minimal respect.\n\nInterim Insight: This suggests our proverb may also deal with how one's circumstances or status follows them regardless of location, and how people are treated based on their perceived standing in society.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat is still eating like that.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A-b\u00e1ni-gb\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed y\u00e1n\u00e1; a-b\u1ecd\u0300r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed sun \u00f2t\u00fat\u00f9; \u1eb9yin g\u1eb9\u0301g\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00ec \u00ed gb\u00e9 \u00e0w\u00f9j\u1ecd\u0301; il\u00e9 kann\u00e1\u00e0 ni w\u1ecd\u0301n k\u1ecd\u0301 f\u00fan \u00e0w\u1ecdn m\u1eb9\u0301t\u1eb9\u0300\u1eb9\u0300ta.\n(Translation: One who lives with others won't lack fire; a devotee of the gods won't suffer cold; a broken egg doesn't stay among the whole ones; the same house was built for all three of them.)\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase emphasizes how one's associations and identity determine their experiences - those who live in community have certain advantages, while those who are \"broken\" (like a broken egg) cannot remain among the whole.\n2. It suggests a natural order where similar things group together and dissimilar things are separated.\n\nInterim Insight: Combined with our proverb, this suggests that Amodu's situation in Ilorin and the goat's continuing behavior reflect a natural consistency - things continue as they are despite changes in location or attempts to alter circumstances.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat is still eating like that.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb speaks to the persistence of nature and character regardless of location or intervention. Just as Amodu's situation in Ilorin hasn't changed, the goat continues its natural behavior of eating in its characteristic way. The proverb teaches that fundamental nature is difficult to change - people and animals tend to maintain their essential character and habits regardless of attempts to change them or changes in their environment. It can be used to comment on the futility of trying to change someone's inherent nature or to observe that despite new circumstances, old patterns persist.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase reinforces how circumstances follow a person regardless of location, while the second phrase emphasizes how natural order tends to maintain itself, with each thing remaining true to its nature.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"K\u00ed ni w\u1ecd\u0301n ti \u0144\u1e63e \u00c0m\u1ecd\u0301d\u00f9 n\u00cdl\u1ecdrin? Ew\u00far\u1eb9\u0301 \u0144j\u1eb9\u0301 b\u1eb9\u0301\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat is still eating like that.\" It conveys that despite changes in location or circumstances, one's essential nature remains unchanged. Just as a goat continues to eat in its characteristic way regardless of what's happening elsewhere, people tend to maintain their fundamental character despite external changes or interventions.
