  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"Today, duiker meat for dinner, tomorrow, duiker meat again; is duiker the only animal in the forest?\"\n\nThe proverb uses the repetition of eating duiker (a small antelope) day after day to express the idea that one shouldn't be limited to a single option when there are many alternatives available. It encourages diversity and exploration rather than sticking with the same thing repeatedly when other possibilities exist."
