  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\n1. \"E\u00e9g\u00fan ju e\u00e9g\u00fan\" - In Yoruba, \"e\u00e9g\u00fan\" refers to masquerades or ancestral spirits, and \"ju\" indicates comparison (surpassing). So this part means \"One masquerade surpasses another masquerade.\"\n\n2. \"\u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e1 ju \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0\" - \"\u00d2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e1\" refers to deities in Yoruba religion, and again we have the comparative \"ju\". This translates to \"One deity surpasses another deity.\"\n\n3. \"P\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1 l\u00e9 on\u00ed\u1e63\u00e0ng\u00f3 w\u1ecd\u0300gb\u1eb9\u0301\" - \"P\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1\" refers to a leopard, \"l\u00e9\" means \"chases\" or \"drives\", \"on\u00ed\u1e63\u00e0ng\u00f3\" is a devotee of Sango (the deity of thunder), and \"w\u1ecd\u0300gb\u1eb9\u0301\" means \"into the bush/forest\".\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb translates to:\n\n\"One masquerade surpasses another; one deity surpasses another; a leopard chases a Sango devotee into the bush.\"\n\nThe meaning conveys a hierarchy of power and fear - just as some spiritual entities are more powerful than others, even a devotee of a powerful deity like Sango will flee when confronted with a real physical danger like a leopard."
