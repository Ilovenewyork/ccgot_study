  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\nThe Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0b\u00far\u00f2 r\u1eb9 \u0144d\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd f\u00fan \u1ecd, o n\u00ed o \u00f2 lo el\u00e9kuru; ta n\u00ed \u0144lo al\u00e1k\u00e0r\u00e0?\" translates to:\n\n\"Your younger sibling is sewing clothes for you, and you say you don't patronize bean cake sellers; who then patronizes bean fritter sellers?\"\n\n## Explanation:\nThis proverb speaks to the inconsistency and ingratitude in human behavior. If you refuse to accept help or patronage from someone close to you (like a family member making clothes for you), yet you expect to receive help or patronage from strangers or those less connected to you, you're being illogical and ungrateful.\n\nThe proverb uses food vendors as a metaphor - \"el\u00e9kuru\" (bean cake seller) represents someone close offering help, while \"al\u00e1k\u00e0r\u00e0\" (bean fritter seller) represents someone more distant. The message is that if you reject assistance from those closest to you, you have no logical basis to expect assistance from others who have less obligation to help you.\n\nThis proverb teaches about appreciating help from family, avoiding ingratitude, and recognizing the inconsistency in rejecting close relationships while seeking more distant ones."
