It suggests that it's better to never hold a position of authority than to hold one and fail to make positive contributions. The wisdom here emphasizes that:\n\n1. The purpose of leadership is to serve and improve the community\n2. A leadership that brings no benefit is worse than no leadership at all\n3. It's about the quality and impact of one's tenure, not merely occupying the position\n\nThe proverb reflects Yoruba values regarding responsible leadership and the importance of leaving a positive legacy rather than simply holding titles without meaningful contributions to the community."
