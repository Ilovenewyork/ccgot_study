  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed ba\u00e1l\u00e8\u0323-\u00e9\u0323 b\u00e1 \u0144t\u00e0k\u00ect\u00ec, \u00f2r\u00f3gi l\u00e0 m\u0301b\u00e1 \u1eb9m\u1eb9s\u00e8\u0323\" can be translated to English as \"If the head of the household is struggling, it is the small tree stumps that we use to support him.\"\n\nExplanation: This proverb highlights the importance of support and assistance within a community or family, especially when the leader or head of the household is facing difficulties. The \"head of the household\" symbolizes a leader or someone in a position of responsibility, while \"small tree stumps\" represent the help and support from others, even if it seems minor or insignificant. The proverb emphasizes that in times of struggle, collective support and cooperation are crucial to overcoming challenges."
