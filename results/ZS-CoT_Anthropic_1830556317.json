It suggests that excessive consumption or greed (symbolized by eating with all ten fingers) is unbecoming of a person with dignity.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\"Eating excessively and without restraint, using all ten fingers to eat, is not befitting of a human being.\"\n\nThe deeper meaning conveys that moderation and self-control in our consumption and desires is an important aspect of being civilized and dignified."
