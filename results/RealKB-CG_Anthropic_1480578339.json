This similar phrase speaks about a young foal that doesn't understand consequences - while its mother is restrained, it roams freely eating grass.\n2. There's a theme of youthful ignorance or inexperience - the foal doesn't recognize that its freedom depends on its mother's restriction.\n3. The phrase suggests a generational disconnect where the young doesn't appreciate the sacrifices or limitations of parents/elders.\n\nInterim Insight: Both proverbs likely deal with inexperience, particularly of youth, and how this leads to inappropriate or unsustainable behavior that doesn't recognize consequences or proper social order.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A child who has never seen soup (preparation) that splashes palm oil on their chest.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \"Aj\u00e1 r\u00ed epo k\u00f2 l\u00e1; \u00ecy\u00e1-a r\u1eb9\u0300\u1eb9\u0301 \u1e63u ih\u00e1 b\u00ed.\"\n(A dog sees palm oil but doesn't lick it; its mother gave birth to a fool.)\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase refers to palm oil (epo), which is also mentioned in our main proverb.\n2. In Yoruba culture, palm oil is valuable - a dog that doesn't lick it is considered foolish or unusual.\n3. The phrase suggests that proper behavior toward valuable things is expected and natural - going against this natural inclination indicates something is wrong.\n4. Both phrases involve relationships with palm oil that reveal character or experience.\n\nInterim Insight: The main proverb likely refers to someone inexperienced who mishandles or wastes valuable resources (palm oil) due to ignorance, while experienced people would know better.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A child who has never witnessed soup preparation splashes palm oil on their chest.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb criticizes someone who mishandles valuable resources due to inexperience. In Yoruba culture, palm oil is precious and used carefully in cooking. Someone who has never seen soup prepared properly might carelessly splash the oil on themselves rather than in the pot. This represents inexperienced people who waste resources, make mistakes, or act inappropriately because they lack proper training or understanding. It's a commentary on how proper knowledge comes from observation and experience, and those without it often make wasteful or foolish decisions.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase shows how youth often don't understand consequences of their actions, while the second emphasizes how proper treatment of valuable resources (like palm oil) is expected from those with sense and proper upbringing.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u1eccm\u1ecd \u00e0\u00ec-j\u1ecdb\u1eb9\u0300-r\u00ed t\u00ed \u0144ja epo s\u00e1y\u00e0\" means \"A child who has never witnessed soup preparation splashes palm oil on their chest.\" It teaches that inexperience leads to waste and improper behavior. Just as someone unfamiliar with cooking might carelessly waste precious palm oil by splashing it on themselves rather than using it properly in food, people without proper knowledge or training often misuse resources or act inappropriately. The proverb emphasizes the importance of learning through observation and experience before handling valuable resources or responsibilities."
