  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u1eb8ni t\u00ed a f\u1eb9\u0301 y\u00e0t\u1ecd\u0300 s\u00ed \u1eb9ni t\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f2 s\u00ed ir\u00fa \u00f2un.\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u1eb8ni t\u00ed a \u00f2 f\u1eb9\u0301, \u00e0l\u1ecd\u0301 \u00f2 k\u00e0n \u00e1n.\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eb8ni t\u00ed a \u00f2 f\u1eb9\u0301, \u00e0l\u1ecd\u0301 \u00f2 k\u00e0n \u00e1n\" translates roughly to \"The person who is not loved/wanted is not involved in the discussion/conversation.\"\n2. This suggests a cultural context where social inclusion or exclusion is based on affection or preference.\n3. It indicates that in Yoruba culture, those who are not favored might be excluded from important conversations or decisions.\n4. This similar phrase emphasizes the consequences of not being the preferred person in a situation.\n\nInterim Insight: There appears to be a cultural theme about differential treatment based on preference or favor, where being the favored one grants privileges and inclusion.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The person that we love/want is different from the person who says there is no one like him/her.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eb8ni t\u00ed a \u00f2 f\u1eb9\u0301 n\u00edl\u00f9\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed j\u00f3 l\u00f3j\u00fa agbo.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eb8ni t\u00ed a \u00f2 f\u1eb9\u0301 n\u00edl\u00f9\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed j\u00f3 l\u00f3j\u00fa agbo\" translates to \"The person who is not wanted/loved in town does not dance in the public square.\"\n2. This proverb reinforces the idea that those who aren't favored by the community don't get to showcase themselves publicly.\n3. It adds the dimension of public performance and recognition being tied to social acceptance.\n4. There's an implication of community consensus about who is valued and who isn't.\n\nInterim Insight: The cultural context emphasizes how community perception determines someone's opportunities for expression and recognition. Self-assessment differs from how others perceive and value you.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The person we love is different from the person who claims there is no one like them.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the disconnect between self-perception and external validation. It suggests that people who boast about their uniqueness or superiority (\"there is no one like me\") may not actually be the ones who are truly valued or loved by others. In Yoruba culture, community opinion often matters more than self-assessment. The proverb serves as a humbling reminder that our own high opinion of ourselves doesn't necessarily align with how others see us. It cautions against arrogance and self-importance, emphasizing that genuine affection and respect from others is more meaningful than self-proclaimed greatness.\n\n- References: The similar phrases reinforce this interpretation by showing how those who aren't favored by the community face exclusion (Similar Phrase 1) and aren't given platforms for public expression (Similar Phrase 2), regardless of their self-perception.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u1eb8ni t\u00ed a f\u1eb9\u0301 y\u00e0t\u1ecd\u0300 s\u00ed \u1eb9ni t\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f2 s\u00ed ir\u00fa \u00f2un\" translates to \"The person we love is different from the person who claims there is no one like them.\" It reveals the Yoruba cultural wisdom about the gap between self-importance and actual community valuation. It warns that those who boast about their uniqueness may not be the ones truly valued by the community. This reflects the Yoruba emphasis on humility and the importance of community validation over self-aggrandizement. The proverb serves as a reminder that how others perceive us often matters more than our perception of ourselves in traditional Yoruba social contexts."
