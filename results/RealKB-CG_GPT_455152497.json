The phrase \"Al\u00e1\u1e63ej\u00f9 n\u00ed \u0144gb\u00e9\u0323b\u1ecd k\u1ecdj\u00e1 \u00ecd\u00ed \u00e8\u1e63\u00f9\" suggests that excessive behavior or overindulgence leads to crossing boundaries that should not be crossed, symbolized by \"\u00ecd\u00ed \u00e8\u1e63\u00f9\" (the boundary of the deity \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9, known for being a trickster and enforcer of moral codes).\n2. The imagery of crossing sacred or moral boundaries due to excessiveness can be related to the proverb, which discusses the consequences of not knowing when to stop or moderate one's actions.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely deals with the dangers of excessiveness and the importance of moderation, as excessive behavior can lead to negative consequences.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation**  \nTranslation: \"Not knowing when to stop eating kills the monkey; not knowing when to stop eating kills the bat; not knowing when to stop eating kills the owl.\"\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection**  \nSimilar Phrase 2: Ak\u00fa, nk\u00f2 n\u00ed omitooro-o r\u00e8\u0323 \u00e9\u0323 l\u00e1; \u00e0\u00eck\u00fa, nk\u00f2 n\u00ed\u00ed p\u00e8 \u00e9 r\u00e1n n\u00ed\u1e63\u00e9\u0323.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2**  \nChain-of-Thought:  \n1. The phrase \"Ak\u00fa, nk\u00f2 n\u00ed omitooro-o r\u00e8\u0323 \u00e9\u0323 l\u00e1; \u00e0\u00eck\u00fa, nk\u00f2 n\u00ed\u00ed p\u00e8 \u00e9 r\u00e1n n\u00ed\u1e63\u00e9\u0323\" highlights the idea of consequences and the finality of death, as well as the inability to correct or utilize something once it is gone.\n2. This adds depth to the proverb by emphasizing the irreversible consequences of failing to moderate one's actions, as once the damage is done (symbolized by death), it cannot be undone.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb underscores the irreversible nature of consequences that arise from lack of moderation, similar to how death is final and cannot be reversed.\n\n**Final Synthesis:**  \n- Final Translation: \"Not knowing when to stop eating kills the monkey; not knowing when to stop eating kills the bat; not knowing when to stop eating kills the owl.\"  \n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: The proverb"
