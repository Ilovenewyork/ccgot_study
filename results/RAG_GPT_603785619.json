It suggests that significant challenges or battles cannot be successfully overcome by an individual alone, regardless of their strength or capabilities. Instead, it highlights the need for teamwork, support, and unity to achieve success, especially in difficult situations. The proverb can be applied to various contexts, encouraging people to seek help and work together rather than trying to tackle problems on their own."
