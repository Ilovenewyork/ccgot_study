  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"If the elder has mucus in his nose, it is not the chicken that will point it out.\"\n\nThis proverb speaks to the concept of respect for elders and social hierarchy in Yoruba culture. It suggests that it's not the place of someone of lower status (represented by the chicken) to point out the flaws or mistakes of someone in a position of authority or respect (the elder). It teaches about knowing one's place in social interactions and the importance of respecting established hierarchies."
