  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the key words:\n- \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0\" means \"elderly person\" or \"elder\"\n- \"ak\u00e0n\" refers to a crab\n- \"t\u00f3 k\u00f3 s\u00ed garawa\" means \"who enters/falls into a basket\"\n- \"y\u00e8g\u00e8d\u00e8\" can be translated as \"completely\" or \"totally\"\n- \"oj\u00fa t\u00ec \u00ed\" means \"becomes ashamed\" or \"feels embarrassed\"\n\nPutting it together, the literal translation would be:\n\"An elderly crab that completely falls into a basket feels embarrassed.\"\n\nThe meaning of this proverb is about how shameful it is when an elder or experienced person makes a mistake that even beginners should know to avoid. It suggests that those with experience should know better than to fall into obvious traps or make elementary mistakes.\n\nIn English, we might express a similar sentiment with phrases like \"You can't teach an old dog new tricks\" or \"An old fox should not be caught in a trap,\" though the Yoruba proverb specifically emphasizes the shame or embarrassment that comes with such a mistake."
