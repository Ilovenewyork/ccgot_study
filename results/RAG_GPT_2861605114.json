  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c8\u0323y\u00e1 l\u00f3 b\u00ed mi, \u1eb9k\u00f9n l\u00f3 w\u00f2 m\u00ed d\u00e0gb\u00e0, ol\u00f3g\u00ecnn\u00ed gb\u00e0 m\u00ed to\u0301\u0323; b\u00ed k\u00f2 s\u00e9\u0323ran lo\u0301\u0323b\u00e8\u0323 nk\u00f2 j\u1eb9\" can be translated to English as: \"The fish gave birth to me, the tiger raised me, the hunter trained me; if there is no meat in the soup, I won't eat.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb is a metaphorical expression that highlights the speaker's upbringing and the standards they have been accustomed to. The mention of being born by a fish, raised by a tiger, and trained by a hunter suggests a background of strength, resilience, and high expectations. The concluding part, \"if there is no meat in the soup, I won't eat,\" implies that the speaker has certain standards or expectations that must be met. It reflects a refusal to settle for less than what they believe they deserve or are used to. In essence, the proverb speaks to maintaining one's standards and not compromising on quality or expectations."
