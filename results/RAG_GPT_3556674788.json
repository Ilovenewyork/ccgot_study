  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"K\u00e0k\u00e0 k\u00e1 do\u0300\u0323b\u00e1l\u00e8\u0323 f\u00fan G\u00e0m\u0300b\u00e0r\u00ed, k\u00e1 ro\u0301\u0323j\u00fa k\u00e1 k\u00fa\" can be translated to English as \"Instead of bowing down to a Fulani, we would rather endure and die.\"\n\nThis proverb emphasizes the value of dignity and self-respect over submission or humiliation. In this context, \"G\u00e0m\u0300b\u00e0r\u00ed\" refers to the Fulani people, who are traditionally seen as outsiders or conquerors in some Yoruba narratives. The proverb suggests that it is better to endure hardship or even face death than to compromise one's principles or self-respect by submitting to someone perceived as an oppressor or someone who does not have one's best interests at heart. It highlights the importance of maintaining one's integrity and standing firm in the face of adversity."
