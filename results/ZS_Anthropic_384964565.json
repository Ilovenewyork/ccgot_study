  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to:\n\n\"Darkness does not recognize anyone; it cast Ifa divination for 'Is that you?'\"\n\nThe meaning conveys that in darkness, people cannot recognize each other, leading to uncertainty and confusion where people must ask \"Is that you?\" to confirm identities. It speaks to how lack of clarity or knowledge creates situations where we cannot distinguish between friend and foe, or truth and falsehood."
