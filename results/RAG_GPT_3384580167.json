  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"E\u00e9g\u00fan ju e\u00e9g\u00fan; \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e1 ju \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0; P\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1 l\u00e9 on\u00ed\u1e63\u00e0ng\u00f3 wo\u0300\u0323gb\u00e9\u0323\" can be translated to English as \"Masquerade surpasses masquerade; deity surpasses deity; P\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1 (a type of masquerade) overpowers the Sango worshipper.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb highlights the concept of hierarchy and superiority within similar categories. It suggests that within any group or category, there are always individuals or entities that are superior to others. The proverb uses the imagery of masquerades (e\u00e9g\u00fan) and deities (\u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e1) to illustrate this point. In Yoruba culture, masquerades and deities are significant, and there are different levels of power and influence among them. The mention of \"P\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1\" and \"on\u00ed\u1e63\u00e0ng\u00f3\" (Sango worshipper) further emphasizes the idea that even among powerful entities, there are those that are more dominant or influential. This proverb can be applied to various aspects of life, reminding us that there is always someone or something greater, and it encourages humility and recognition of hierarchy."
