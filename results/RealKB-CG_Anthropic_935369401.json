  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"A-bin\u00fa-f\u00f9f\u00f9 n\u00ed \u0144w\u00e1 o\u00fanj\u1eb9 f\u00fan a-bin\u00fa-w\u1eb9\u0301r\u1eb9\u0301-w\u1eb9\u0301r\u1eb9\u0301.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00c0 \u0144w\u00e1 \u1eb9ni t\u00ed a \u00f3 f\u1ecdm\u1ecd f\u00fan, ol\u00f2\u1e63\u00ec \u0144y\u1ecdj\u00fa\" translates roughly to \"While we're looking for someone to entrust our child to, the irresponsible one shows up first.\"\n2. This phrase suggests an ironic situation where unsuitable people present themselves for important responsibilities.\n3. Both phrases use a structure that sets up a relationship between two types of people.\n4. There's an underlying theme of mismatched capabilities and responsibilities.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase helps us understand that the proverb likely deals with a situation where someone unsuitable takes on a responsibility, specifically someone who lacks the proper temperament.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The one who gets excessively angry is the one who finds/provides food for the one who gets mildly angry.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A-d\u00e1-m\u00e1-l\u00e8-\u1e63e \u00e0d\u00e0b\u00e0 t\u00ed \u0144d\u00fan b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" roughly translates to \"The incompetent dove that makes the loud noise.\" \n2. This phrase criticizes those who make big shows or noise despite lacking capability.\n3. It suggests a mismatch between one's abilities and their actions or claims.\n4. Like our proverb, it highlights irony in behavior - someone who shouldn't be in a position to help is the one offering help.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces that our proverb is about the irony of situations where those least suited for a task (due to their excessive anger) are the ones taking responsibility for others (who are less angry).\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The one who gets excessively angry provides food for the one who gets mildly angry.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the irony where someone with poor emotional control (the excessively angry person) somehow becomes responsible for taking care of someone with better emotional control (the mildly angry person). It speaks to situations where roles are reversed inappropriately - those who need guidance themselves are attempting to guide others. In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to criticize situations where authority or responsibility is given to those who lack the temperament or capability to handle it properly, similar to putting an unstable person in charge of caring for others.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 (\"We look for someone to entrust our child to, and the irresponsible one shows up\") and Similar Phrase 2 (\"The incompetent dove that makes the loud noise\") both reinforce the proverb's theme of mismatched capabilities and responsibilities."
