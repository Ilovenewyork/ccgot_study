The suffix \"-\u00e9\u0323\" is a possessive pronoun, meaning \"his\" or \"her,\" but in this context, it emphasizes the subject.\n3. **b\u00e1** - This is a verb that means \"is\" or \"does.\"\n4. **\u0144t\u00e0k\u00ect\u00ec** - This means \"is struggling\" or \"is in difficulty.\"\n5. **\u00f2r\u00f3gi** - This refers to \"a stick\" or \"a support.\"\n6. **l\u00e0** - This means \"we use\" or \"we take.\"\n7. **m\u0301b\u00e1** - This means \"to support\" or \"to assist.\"\n8. **\u1eb9m\u1eb9s\u00e8\u0323** - This means \"the weak\" or \"the vulnerable.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as:\n\"When the head of the household is struggling, we use a stick to support the weak.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that when a leader or someone in a position of responsibility is facing difficulties, it is important to provide support to those who are vulnerable or in need."
