The phrase about \u00c0j\u00e0p\u00e1 (the tortoise) highlights the cunning and unpredictable nature of the tortoise, a common character in Yoruba folklore known for its cleverness and trickery.\n2. The phrase suggests that the tortoise's journey is not bound by time but by its own pace and decisions, emphasizing self-determination and the unpredictability of outcomes.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely involves themes of unpredictability and the idea that appearances or initial intentions may not reveal the true outcome or purpose.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation**  \nTranslation: \"The mirror and the razor are going to the bush, they say they are going to catch a runaway chicken, we did not see the sacrifice.\"\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection**  \nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0gb\u00e0\u00e0gb\u00e0 \u00ecl\u00fa \u00f2 l\u00e8 p\u00e9j\u1ecd k\u00ed w\u1ecdn \u00f3 j\u1eb9 \u00ecfun \u00f2k\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0fi iy\u00e1n \u00e0n\u00e1.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2**  \nChain-of-Thought:  \n1. This phrase suggests that elders or wise people do not gather to engage in trivial or inappropriate actions, implying that their actions are purposeful and considered.\n2. It emphasizes the importance of understanding the true intentions behind actions, as appearances can be deceiving.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely conveys a message about the hidden motives behind actions and the importance of looking beyond surface appearances to understand true intentions.\n\n**Final Synthesis:**  \n- Final Translation: \"The mirror and the razor are going to the bush, they say they are going to catch a runaway chicken, but we did not see the sacrifice.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: The proverb suggests that the stated intentions of individuals or objects may not align with their true purpose or outcome. It warns against taking things at face value and encourages a deeper understanding of motives and actions, much like the unpredictable nature of the tortoise or the purposeful actions of elders.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1, Similar Phrase 2\n\n**Final Answer:**  \nThe proverb \"A\u00e1y\u00e1n ati e\u00e8r\u00e0\u00e1 \u1e63\u00edgun, wo\u0301\u0323n n\u00ed \u00e0wo\u0301\u0323n \u0144"
