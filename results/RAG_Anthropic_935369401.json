  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n**Literal translation:**\n\"The one who gets angry and puffs up is the one who looks for food for the one who gets mildly angry.\"\n\n**Meaning:**\nThis Yoruba proverb contrasts two types of angry people - the one who shows intense, dramatic anger (f\u00f9f\u00f9 - puffing up) versus the one whose anger is milder or more restrained (w\u1eb9\u0301r\u1eb9\u0301-w\u1eb9\u0301r\u1eb9\u0301 - mild/gentle).\n\nThe proverb suggests that the person who makes a big show of their anger often ends up working for or serving those who maintain composure. The dramatic person expends so much energy on emotional displays that they actually end up in a position of providing for or working to benefit the calmer person.\n\nIt teaches that excessive emotional reactions often lead to disadvantageous positions, while those who control their temper tend to benefit. This proverb encourages emotional restraint and warns against letting anger drive one to impulsive or dramatic behavior that ultimately works against one's own interests."
