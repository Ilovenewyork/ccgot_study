  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"E\u0323ni \u00e0 \u0144gb\u00e9 g\u00e8\u0323g\u00e8\u0323 ni y\u00f3 ba ara-a r\u00e8\u0323 j\u00e9\u0323\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **E\u0323ni** - This means \"the person\" or \"someone.\"\n2. **\u00e0 \u0144gb\u00e9** - This phrase means \"we are carrying\" or \"we are supporting.\"\n3. **g\u00e8\u0323g\u00e8\u0323** - This word means \"carelessly\" or \"recklessly.\"\n4. **ni y\u00f3** - This means \"will\" or \"is the one who will.\"\n5. **ba ara-a r\u00e8\u0323 j\u00e9\u0323** - This phrase means \"harm themselves\" or \"spoil their own body.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated to English as: \"The person we are carrying carelessly will harm themselves.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that if someone is being supported or helped in a careless or reckless manner, it is ultimately that person who will suffer the consequences."
