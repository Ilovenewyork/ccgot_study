  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"'Pull him inside' is appropriate for a horseman.\"\n\nThe proverb suggests that a horseman (someone of status or in a position of authority) should be treated with respect and welcomed properly, by inviting or pulling them inside, rather than leaving them outside. It speaks to showing proper respect and hospitality to people according to their status or position."
