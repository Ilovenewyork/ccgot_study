It suggests that it is better for an elder to die with their honor and dignity intact than to live and suffer the shame of disgrace or the indignity of mental deterioration.\n\nIn Yoruba society, elders are highly revered and respected for their wisdom and experience. Their status comes with honor and dignity. This proverb reflects the cultural value that maintaining one's honor until death is preferable to losing one's dignity, respect, or mental faculties in old age.\n\nThe proverb teaches about the importance of living honorably and the value of dignity over mere existence. It also acknowledges the painful reality that sometimes death can be more merciful than living through certain forms of suffering or humiliation."
