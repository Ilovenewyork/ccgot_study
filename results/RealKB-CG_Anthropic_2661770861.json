  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"On\u00edg\u1eb9\u0300g\u1eb9\u0301 f\u00ecl\u1eb9\u0300k\u1eb9\u0300 d\u1ecd\u0301p\u1ecd\u0300; on\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300k\u1eb9\u0300 \u00ecb\u00e1 gbowo, ko r\u1ecd\u0301r\u00f9n f\u00ecl\u1eb9\u0300k\u1eb9\u0300 so.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00c0lej\u00f2 k\u00ec \u00ed l\u1ecd k\u00f3 m\u00fa on\u00edl\u00e9 d\u00e1n\u00ed\" translates to \"A visitor doesn't leave and then put the host in trouble/debt.\"\n2. This suggests a relationship dynamic where one party (visitor/guest) shouldn't burden or exploit another party (host/owner).\n3. The relationship appears hierarchical or transactional, with clear roles and responsibilities.\n4. It emphasizes ethical conduct in relationships and respecting boundaries.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely deals with a relationship between someone who has something and someone who uses or benefits from it, and proper conduct within that relationship.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The owner of beads leaves beads to accumulate; if the owner of beads had collected money (payment), it would not be easy to tie/string the beads together.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0\u1e63\u00e1 k\u00ec \u00ed r\u00e0 k\u00e1d\u00ec\u1eb9 gb\u00e9 k\u00f2k\u00f2r\u00f2 d\u00e1n\u00ed\" translates to \"The hawk doesn't catch prey so the chicken can eat insects forever.\"\n2. This highlights that predators or powerful entities don't act for the benefit of others, but for themselves.\n3. It suggests natural hierarchies and self-interest in relationships.\n4. The phrase reveals Yoruba understanding of transactional relationships and cautioning against naive expectations.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb is likely about economic transactions and fairness - suggesting that if the owner of something valuable (beads) had demanded payment, they would have lost the opportunity to benefit from the arrangement in the future.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The bead maker leaves beads to accumulate; if the bead owner had demanded immediate payment, it would not be easy to string the beads together later.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches about business wisdom and delayed gratification. It suggests that sometimes allowing resources or investments to accumulate without demanding immediate returns creates opportunities for greater future benefits. In traditional Yoruba economy, beads were valuable commodities that required craftsmanship to arrange. The proverb counsels patience in business dealings - demanding immediate payment might satisfy short-term needs but could prevent larger long-term benefits that come from allowing business relationships to develop naturally. It emphasizes the wisdom of strategic patience and investment rather than immediate profit-taking.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase warns against exploitative relationships, while the second reinforces the natural order of self-interest in transactions. Together they frame the proverb as guidance about balanced and far-sighted economic relationships in Yoruba culture."
