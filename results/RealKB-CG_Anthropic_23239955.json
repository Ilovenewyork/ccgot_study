  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"A p\u00e8 \u1ecd\u0301 l\u1ecd\u0301m\u1ecd er\u00edn-m\u00e0gb\u1ecdn \u00f2 \u0144y\u1ecd\u0300; \u00ecw\u1ecd p\u00e0\u00e1p\u00e0\u00e1 l\u00f3 m\u00ec \u00ed?\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u1ecc\u0300g\u00e0-\u01f9-g\u00e0 l\u1ecdm\u1ecd-\u1ecd\u0300 mi \u0144j\u1eb9\u0301, \u1eb9 m\u00e1 pe \u1ecdm\u1ecd-\u1ecd\u0300 mi n\u00ed \u00d2g\u00f2-\u01f9-g\u00f2 m\u1ecd\u0301! \u00c8wo lor\u00fak\u1ecd rere n\u00edb\u1eb9\u0300?\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This similar phrase translates roughly to \"My child's name is \u1ecc\u0300g\u00e0-\u01f9-g\u00e0, stop calling my child \u00d2g\u00f2-\u01f9-g\u00f2! Which one is the good name there?\" This shows concern about proper naming or identity.\n2. It demonstrates how Yoruba people place importance on proper names and titles - calling someone by an incorrect name or title is considered disrespectful.\n3. There's a play on similar-sounding names, suggesting confusion or deliberate misrepresentation.\n\nInterim Insight: This provides context that the main proverb likely deals with issues of identity, titles, or naming - and possibly how people react to labels given to them.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"They call you the child of an elephant who cannot trumpet; are you the one who even swallows it?\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0j\u00e0n\u00e0k\u00fa \u00f2 tu l\u00f3j\u00fa al\u00e1j\u00e1; o-n\u00edgba-aj\u00e1 \u00f2 gb\u1ecdd\u1ecd\u0300 t\u1ecd\u0301pa erin.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase translates roughly to \"An elephant is not insignificant in the eyes of a dog owner; the owner of two hundred dogs must not follow an elephant's tracks.\" This proverb uses elephant imagery to depict power dynamics.\n2. In Yoruba culture, elephants (erin/\u00e0j\u00e0n\u00e0k\u00fa) symbolize great power, size, and significance.\n3. The inability to trumpet (in the main proverb) refers to not living up to one's expected abilities or family legacy.\n\nInterim Insight: The elephant symbolism clarifies that the main proverb is about someone who fails to demonstrate expected abilities based on their prestigious lineage or position, yet paradoxically takes offense at this observation.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"They call you the offspring of an elephant that cannot trumpet; are you the one who even swallows the trumpet?\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes someone who fails to live up to their family reputation or expected abilities (like an elephant's child who cannot trumpet), yet becomes offended when this shortcoming is pointed out. It addresses the irony of someone taking offense at a truth about their inadequacy. In Yoruba culture, this proverb teaches that one should acknowledge one's limitations rather than become defensive when they are mentioned. It's often used when someone reacts angrily to criticism that accurately points out their failure to meet expectations based on their background or position.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase demonstrates the importance of proper naming and identity in Yoruba culture, while the second phrase establishes the elephant as a symbol of power and significance, making the inability to trumpet (a natural elephant ability) more meaningful as a metaphor for failing to live up to one's heritage.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb criticizes someone who gets offended when their failure to live up to their family legacy or position is pointed out, similar to an elephant's child who cannot trumpet yet becomes angry when this inadequacy is mentioned."
