  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Translation:**\n\"The owner of beads uses beads to make a bundle; if the owner of beads had money, it wouldn't be beads that they would tie together.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis proverb speaks to the concept of making do with what you have, even when it's not ideal. The person who owns beads is using them to bundle things together because that's what they have available. However, if they had money (better resources), they wouldn't resort to using their valuable beads for such a mundane purpose.\n\nThe deeper meaning teaches about:\n1. Making the best of limited resources\n2. Using what you have at hand when necessary, even if it's not the optimal solution\n3. The irony that sometimes people must use their valuables for practical purposes because they lack alternatives\n\nThis proverb reflects the Yoruba philosophy of resourcefulness and adaptation while acknowledging the constraints people face in challenging circumstances."
