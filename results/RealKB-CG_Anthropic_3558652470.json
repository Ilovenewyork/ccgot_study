This phrase highlights self-deception and the reality that no one is indispensable.\n3. It suggests a theme of consequence and personal responsibility that may relate to our target proverb.\n4. Both phrases seem to address misconceptions about one's impact or circumstances.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that the target proverb may deal with self-perception, consequences of actions, or the temporary nature of situations.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The spoilage/misfortune of one day does not finish easily/quickly.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Al\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd-kan k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63er\u00e9 \u00f2j\u00f2\" translates to \"A person with only one garment doesn't play in the rain.\"\n2. This phrase warns about risk management and preparedness - if you have limited resources, you should be cautious.\n3. It suggests consequences can last longer than the initial action (getting wet in rain means having no dry clothes afterward).\n4. This connects to our target proverb about how consequences of bad events can extend far beyond the original incident.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase reinforces that our proverb is about how the effects of misfortune can linger long after the initial event, emphasizing prudence and foresight.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The misfortune of a single day doesn't end quickly.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that the consequences of a single unfortunate event or bad decision can extend far beyond the day it occurs. It warns against impulsive actions by emphasizing that momentary troubles can create lasting effects. In Yoruba culture, which values foresight and wisdom, this proverb serves as a reminder to think about the long-term implications of one's choices. It encourages prudence and careful consideration, recognizing that recovery from setbacks often takes much longer than the events that caused them.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the theme of self-awareness and personal responsibility.
