It advises that one should not depend on others for support or success - neither on those who seem established (the house owner) nor on those who are temporary in your life (the visitor). Instead, the proverb teaches that true strength and stability come from depending on your own resources, abilities, and efforts.\n\nThe wisdom here reflects the Yoruba cultural value of independence and personal accountability. It encourages people to develop their own capabilities rather than becoming dependent on others, regardless of how permanent or temporary those others might be in one's life."
