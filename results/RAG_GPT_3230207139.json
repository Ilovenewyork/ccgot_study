  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed w\u1eb9wo\u0301\u0323 t\u00e1n k\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 j\u1eb9 si\" translates to \"An elder does not finish eating and then say they will eat more.\" \n\nThis proverb emphasizes the wisdom and self-restraint expected of elders. It suggests that a person of maturity and experience should know their limits and not overindulge or be greedy. It also implies that elders should set an example of moderation and contentment for younger generations. The proverb can be applied more broadly to encourage people to be satisfied with what they have and to avoid excessive desires or actions."
