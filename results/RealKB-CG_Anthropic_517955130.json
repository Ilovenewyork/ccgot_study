  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\"Mo m\u1ecd\u0300w\u1ecd\u0300n ara-\u00e0 mi\" k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63\u1eb9\u0300r\u1eb9\u0300k\u1eb9\u0301 \u00e8\u00e9b\u00fa.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00c0gb\u00e0 t\u00ed k\u00f2 m\u1ecd \u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300n ara-a r\u1eb9\u0300 lod\u00f2 \u0144gb\u00e9 l\u1ecd\u0301\" translates to \"An elder who doesn't know his own limits/worth will be carried away by the river.\"\n2. This phrase emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and understanding one's limitations to avoid disaster or embarrassment.\n3. It suggests that even those with high status (elders) can face consequences if they don't recognize their boundaries.\n4. The river imagery represents natural forces or social consequences that overwhelm those who overestimate themselves.\n\nInterim Insight: Both proverbs appear to address self-awareness and the importance of knowing one's place or limits in society. The similar phrase warns of physical danger (being swept away) as a consequence of lacking self-awareness.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One who says 'I know my worth/limits' does not become the subject of mockery/insult.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0k\u00eds\u00e0-\u00e1 m\u1ecd \u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300n ara-a r\u1eb9\u0300, \u00f3 gb\u00e9 p\u00e1r\u00e1 j\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"The rag knows its worth/limit, so it stays on the shelf.\"\n2. This proverb uses the metaphor of a rag knowing its proper place (on the shelf rather than being worn as clothing).\n3. It reinforces the concept that understanding one's position prevents inappropriate actions and subsequent embarrassment.\n4. While the first similar phrase focused on consequences of not knowing limits, this one highlights the benefits of proper self-awareness.\n\nInterim Insight: All three proverbs emphasize self-awareness, but with different perspectives. The original proverb states the positive outcome of self-awareness (avoiding mockery), while the similar phrases illustrate either the negative consequences of lacking it or the appropriate behavior that results from having it.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One who says 'I know my worth/limits' will not become the subject of mockery or insults.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and humility in Yoruba culture. It teaches that those who understand their capabilities, limitations, and proper social position avoid embarrassment and ridicule. In Yoruba society, knowing one's place within the community hierarchy and acting accordingly is highly valued. The proverb suggests that self-awareness serves as protection against social humiliation. It encourages people to be realistic about their abilities and status, neither overreaching (which leads to failure and mockery) nor undervaluing themselves. This reflects the Yoruba emphasis on balanced living, social harmony, and the wisdom that comes from accurate self-assessment.\n\n- References: The river that carries away the unaware elder (Similar Phrase 1) and the rag that knows to stay on the shelf (Similar Phrase 2) both reinforce the consequences of ignoring one's proper place and the benefits of self-awareness."
