  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the components:\n- \"A k\u00ec \u00ed b\u1ecd \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 l\u00f3j\u00fa \u1ecd\u0300f\u1ecd\u0301n-\u1ecd\u0300n\" - This first part refers to not worshipping/making offerings to a deity (\u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0) during a time of scarcity (\u1ecd\u0300f\u1ecd\u0301n-\u1ecd\u0300n refers to a period of hunger or lack)\n- \"b\u00f3 b\u00e1 dal\u1eb9\u0301\" - When prosperity/abundance comes\n- \"a m\u00e1a t\u00fa p\u1eb9p\u1eb9\" - One will build/set up a proper altar\n\nPutting it together:\n\"One does not worship the deity during times of scarcity; when prosperity comes, one will build a proper altar.\"\n\nThe meaning conveys that people often neglect spiritual obligations during hard times but become devoted when prosperity returns. It speaks to the inconsistency of fair-weather devotion or opportunistic faith."
