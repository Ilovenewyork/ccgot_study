  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translated into English is:\n\n\"A rope that is long enough to tie a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant from going; a rope that claims it can stop an elephant from going to Alo, both the rope and the elephant will go together.\"\n\nThe meaning conveys that when something or someone tries to restrain a much more powerful force, they may end up being carried along instead of stopping it. It speaks to understanding the limits of one's power or ability when confronting something far stronger."
