  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Translation:**\n\"You are called 'child of an elephant' and you're not proud; are you the one who swallowed it?\"\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis proverb is about being given an honorable or prestigious title but failing to appreciate it. The humor comes from the absurd notion that someone might have \"swallowed\" an elephant rather than being its offspring.\n\nThe proverb criticizes someone who is given a compliment or prestigious association (being called a child of the mighty elephant) but shows no pride or appreciation for this honor. The rhetorical question at the end (\"are you the one who swallowed it?\") emphasizes the absurdity of not appreciating such a significant title.\n\nThe proverb teaches that one should appreciate and be grateful for honors, compliments, or prestigious associations rather than showing indifference or ingratitude. It encourages people to recognize and value their positive connections and heritage."
