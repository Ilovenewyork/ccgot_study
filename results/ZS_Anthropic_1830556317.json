  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"After finishing eating, pretending not to be satisfied, and eating with ten fingers is not befitting of a human being.\"\n\nThe proverb is essentially criticizing greed and poor manners - specifically the behavior of someone who has already eaten their fill but pretends to still be hungry, and then eats in an unrefined way (using all fingers rather than the culturally appropriate manner). It teaches about dignity, proper conduct, and being content with what one has received."
