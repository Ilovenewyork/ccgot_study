  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb by breaking it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me identify the key elements:\n- \"Ibi t\u00ed a ti \u0144p\u00ect\u00e0n\" = \"The place where stories/history are told\"\n- \"k\u00e1 t\u00f3 jog\u00fan\" = \"before we inherit/receive inheritance\"\n- \"k\u00e1 m\u1ecd\u0300 p\u00e9\" = \"we should know that\"\n- \"og\u00fan ib\u1eb9\u0300\" = \"the inheritance there\"\n- \"\u00f2 kanni\" = \"does not affect us/concern us\"\n\nPutting it together in natural English:\n\"Before we inherit from a place, we should learn its history to know if that inheritance truly belongs to us.\"\n\nThe deeper meaning of this proverb suggests that we should understand the full context and history of something before claiming it as our own. It warns against accepting inheritance or benefits without first understanding their origins or implications."
