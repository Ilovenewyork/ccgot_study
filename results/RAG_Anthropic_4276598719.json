It conveys the idea that people who have committed errors or transgressions have an internal awareness of their guilt, even if they pretend otherwise.\n\n**Cultural Context**: In Yoruba culture, this proverb is often used to remind people that conscience is a powerful force - those who have done wrong carry the knowledge of their actions with them. It's similar to the English expression \"the guilty mind needs no accuser\" or \"the guilty person knows their own guilt.\"\n\n**Usage**: This saying might be employed when someone denies wrongdoing but shows signs of guilt, or in situations where a community knows someone is responsible for a misdeed even without direct evidence. It emphasizes personal accountability and self-awareness regarding one's actions."
