The name \"\u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" translates to \"Wealth is troublesome\" or \"Wealth brings problems.\" The proverb suggests that because the person has never encountered wealth, they might assume it brings more trouble than benefit, hence naming their child in a way that reflects this belief. It highlights the notion that people often fear or misunderstand what they have not experienced themselves."

The proverb suggests that when someone tries to imitate or compare themselves to someone else without having the same capabilities or resilience, they may end up in unfavorable or uncomfortable situations. In this context, \"sleeping behind the kitchen\" implies being in a less desirable or inferior position. The proverb serves as a caution against comparing oneself to others without understanding their unique strengths or circumstances."

The chameleon claims it can navigate its path, but the question posed is who has ever walked the path of a chameleon. This suggests that the chameleon's path is unique and not easily understood or followed by others.\n\nThe proverb is often used to highlight the idea that some individuals or situations are unique and cannot be easily imitated or comprehended by others. It emphasizes the distinctiveness of certain experiences or abilities, suggesting that what works for one may not necessarily work for another.

The proverb uses the imagery of masquerades (e\u00e9g\u00fan) and deities (\u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e1) to illustrate this point.

In this context, the person has been sold (metaphorically) and the proceeds used to buy a cutlass, which is a tool associated with hard work and labor. The person then complains about the hardship or suffering that comes with using the cutlass. It highlights the irony of someone lamenting the difficulties that arise from a situation they are directly responsible for or have contributed to.

The proverb suggests that an elder who fails to show respect to a leader or someone of higher status is essentially bringing trouble upon themselves.

In this context, the eunuch, who is physically incapable of procreation, represents someone with an unattainable desire. The king, who is typically seen as powerful and capable of granting wishes, is powerless in this situation because the desire itself is beyond the realm of possibility. The proverb emphasizes the idea that some things are simply beyond anyone's control, regardless of their status or power."

It suggests that a person, especially one in a subordinate position (like a slave), is restricted to what is available or permissible within their environment or circumstances. In a broader sense, it can be interpreted to mean that people should not overstep their bounds or attempt to acquire things that are beyond their reach or not meant for them. It emphasizes the importance of understanding one's place and acting within the limits of one's role or situation."

In the context of the hawk, which is a bird of prey, it would naturally go for the more substantial and valuable prey (the chick) rather than something insignificant (the insect). \n\nThe proverb is often used to emphasize the importance of prioritizing significant goals or objectives over trivial matters.

It suggests that no matter how much wisdom or strategy is applied to a situation, if a person is not open to accepting advice or solutions, the effort is wasted. The use of \"la\u1e63iw\u00e8r\u00e9\" (a mad person) emphasizes the stubbornness or irrationality of such an individual, who ultimately dismisses all logical discourse with a simple refusal.

In contrast, someone who constantly claims that there is no one like them may not be as genuinely loved or appreciated. The proverb emphasizes the value of humility and the idea that true love is not about self-promotion but about genuine connection and appreciation."

The palm tree and the rope symbolize efforts or measures that are inadequate for the task at hand. The elephant represents a powerful force or situation that cannot be easily stopped or controlled. The proverb suggests that one should recognize the limits of their abilities and not overestimate their capacity to control or influence situations that are inherently beyond their control. It is a reminder to be realistic about one's capabilities and to avoid self-deception."

It highlights the irony of someone who lacks understanding or experience trying to handle a situation that is beyond their grasp. The imagery of a child putting palm oil in their pocket suggests a lack of awareness of the consequences, as the oil will obviously stain and ruin the pocket, just as inexperience can lead to mistakes or problems."

It suggests that certain things, such as traits, responsibilities, or possessions, are passed down from parents to their children. The proverb implies that there is a natural order or process through which things are transferred from one generation to the next, and this process cannot be bypassed or altered.

However, the proverb makes a distinction when it comes to a lazy person (\"ato\u0300\u0323o\u0301\u0323l\u00e9\"). For a lazy person, any sign of struggle or difficulty is not due to genuine effort or hardship but rather a result of their own lack of initiative or diligence. Essentially, the proverb suggests that while everyone may have their burdens, the lazy person cannot use this as an excuse for their lack of progress or success. It emphasizes the importance of effort and the difference between genuine challenges and those that arise from laziness."

It emphasizes resilience and the ability to recover from setbacks. The underlying message is that challenges or failures, no matter how significant they may seem at the moment, do not define the entirety of a situation or the future.

The phrase \"we shall see\" implies skepticism about their ability to achieve this goal.

The message conveyed is that certain forces or constraints are not strong enough to stop someone or something that is determined and powerful. It emphasizes the idea that true strength and determination cannot be easily hindered by external limitations or obstacles. The elephant, representing a powerful force, will go where it wants, regardless of the attempts to restrain it. This can be applied to human situations where individuals or entities with strong will and determination are not easily stopped by challenges or restrictions."

It suggests that when someone attempts to do something beyond their power or capability, they are more likely to harm themselves or fail in the process. It serves as a caution against arrogance and encourages self-awareness and humility."

The \"old crab\" symbolizes an elder or someone with experience. The \"wide-mouthed container\" represents a situation that should be easy to navigate or escape from due to the elder's experience. However, if the elder finds themselves trapped or unable to handle the situation, it brings about a sense of shame or embarrassment.\n\nThe proverb highlights the expectation that with age and experience comes the ability to handle situations adeptly. When an elder fails to do so, it can be seen as a failure to live up to the wisdom and capability that is typically associated with age. It serves as a reminder of the importance of living up to one's experience and the potential embarrassment when one does not."

The proverb suggests that no matter how wise or knowledgeable one may be, they cannot surpass the wisdom or insight that is specifically meant for the person receiving the divination. It emphasizes the idea that certain knowledge or guidance is uniquely tailored to an individual's situation, and it is not for others to claim or understand fully.\n\nThe proverb teaches humility and respect for the personal and unique nature of divine guidance.

The dove is often associated with peace and gentleness, and the sound \"b\u00e8\u0323m\u0300b\u00e8\u0323\" suggests a loud or disruptive noise, which is not characteristic of a dove.

The proverb suggests that a person who is responsible for a particular task or role (in this case, playing the drum) cannot simultaneously engage in another activity that requires their full attention (such as dancing).

In Yoruba culture, elders are highly respected, and their wisdom and experience are valued. The proverb suggests that it is preferable for an elder to pass away with their honor intact rather than live to see a day when they are humiliated or lose their respect in the community. It underscores the value placed on honor and the legacy one leaves behind, highlighting that a dignified end is more honorable than a life that ends in disgrace."

In the context of the proverb, the younger sibling is making clothes, which is an act of kindness and support. However, the person dismisses this effort by saying they don't wear rags, implying that the clothes made by the sibling are not good enough. The rhetorical question \"who then wears patched clothes?\" highlights the irony and ungratefulness of the situation, suggesting that if you cannot appreciate the effort of someone close to you, then who else will you appreciate?\n\nThe proverb teaches the importance of gratitude and recognizing the value in the efforts and contributions of others, even if they do not meet one's personal standards or expectations."

The final part, \"\u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 t\u00f3 w\u00e8\u0323w\u00f9 \u00e0\u1e63ej\u00f9 \u00e8\u0323t\u00e9\u0323 ni y\u00f3 fi r\u00ed\" (an elder who wears the garment of excess will end in disgrace), serves as a cautionary note, particularly to those who are expected to be wise and moderate, like elders, that indulging in excess will lead to shame and dishonor. Overall, the proverb advises moderation and balance in all things."

The \"red eyes\" symbolize the ongoing stress, worry, or regret that follows a hasty or destructive action. It serves as a caution to be mindful of our actions, as their impact can be long-lasting."

The first part of the proverb suggests that something seemingly small or insignificant (like a child's portion of food) can be sufficient or beneficial for someone much older or more experienced (an elder). It implies that wisdom, knowledge, or benefits can come from unexpected or humble sources.\n\nThe second part of the proverb contrasts this by stating that a child's ring cannot fit an elder's finger, emphasizing that not everything from a smaller or younger source can be applicable or suitable for an older or more mature context. This part of the proverb serves as a reminder that while some things can transcend their original scope, others are limited by their nature or design.\n\nOverall, the proverb teaches the importance of recognizing the potential value in small or youthful contributions while also understanding the limitations that may come with them."

It suggests that one should not take on challenges or tasks that are beyond their capability or strength. Just as it would be unwise for a dog to venture into the wilderness to hunt a much stronger and more dangerous animal like a leopard, it is similarly unwise for a person to engage in endeavors that are beyond their capacity to handle.

It questions the wisdom of focusing on just one thing when there are many other possibilities available. The duiker, a type of small antelope, is used metaphorically to represent a resource or opportunity that is being overly depended upon.

This proverb highlights the dynamics and potential tensions within such a household. When a wife disciplines or beats the child of another wife, it is often seen as a provocative action. The proverb suggests that the wife is not merely disciplining the child but is likely trying to provoke a reaction or start a conversation, possibly to address underlying issues or grievances. It implies that her actions are intentional and aimed at eliciting a response, either from the child\u2019s mother or from others in the household.

The phrase \"E\u0323nu\u00f9 mi \u00f2 k\u00e1 \u00ecl\u00fa\" (My mouth cannot encompass the town) suggests an inability to manage or control the affairs of the community.

It suggests that certain greetings or acknowledgments are context-specific and should be used appropriately. For instance, saying \"Welcome home\" to someone who already lives there is unnecessary, just as saying \"Well done for your effort\" to someone who is not actively participating or contributing is inappropriate.\n\nThe proverb also highlights the idea of reciprocity in social relationships. If you do not acknowledge or greet others appropriately, you may not receive the same courtesy in return. It underscores the importance of being considerate and mindful in social interactions, as failing to do so can lead to missed opportunities for connection and mutual respect."

In this context, the wagging of the dog's tail is a visible sign that something is happening, specifically that someone is eating. It suggests that when you see a reaction or a result, there is usually a reason behind it.

The proverb suggests that someone who is constantly being helped or carried by others, without making efforts on their own, will eventually harm themselves or fail to develop self-reliance. It emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility and the potential negative consequences of over-dependence on others."

This proverb emphasizes the importance and benefits of early action or starting something promptly. It suggests that when you begin a task or project early, you are more likely to succeed or see positive results.

It emphasizes the idea that ignoring issues does not make them go away; instead, it often leads to more significant problems that one will eventually have to confront. The proverb serves as a caution against willful ignorance and encourages proactive engagement with challenges."

The bead seller, who should be responsible for the beads, has carelessly left them on the ground. If the rightful owner of the beads were to demand accountability or payment, it would be a challenging task to gather and string the beads back together. The proverb serves as a cautionary reminder to be diligent and responsible in one's actions, as neglect can lead to difficult situations and the need to rectify mistakes."

It highlights the idea that without proper preparation or resources, achieving one's goals can be difficult or impossible."

It suggests that challenging or confronting someone with significant power or influence is likely to result in consequences or repercussions. The \"king's staff\" symbolizes the authority and power that the king wields, and the act of it striking someone on the leg represents the inevitable consequences of challenging such authority. The proverb serves as a cautionary reminder to be mindful of the power dynamics in any situation and to approach those in authority with respect and caution."
