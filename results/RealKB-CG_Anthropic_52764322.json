The similar phrase \"\u00c0-gb\u00e0b\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd \u1e63\u00f2k\u00f2t\u00f2, b\u00ed k\u00f2 f\u00fanni l\u1eb9\u0301s\u1eb9\u0300 a \u1e63oni; r\u1eb9\u0301m\u00far\u1eb9\u0301m\u00fa ni ohun \u1eb9ni \u1e3fbani mu\" contains elements from our target proverb.\n2. It refers to borrowed trousers (\u1e63\u00f2k\u00f2t\u00f2) and suggests that if they don't fit properly, they will embarrass the wearer.\n3. The ending suggests that one's own possessions fit or suit one best.\n4. The imagery centers on clothing that doesn't belong to you causing discomfort or embarrassment.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests the proverb is about how borrowed items (particularly clothes) don't suit a person as well as their own possessions, and may even cause embarrassment or difficulty.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Borrowed money does not suit one; borrowed trousers do not suit a person; if it doesn't fit one's legs it becomes awkward/uncomfortable; one's own things are what suit one.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The second similar phrase \"\u1ecc\u0300\u1e63\u1ecd\u0301 \u1ecdl\u1ecd\u0301\u1e63\u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301 \u00f2 y\u1eb9ni; \u1e63\u00f2k\u00f2t\u00f2 \u00e0gb\u00e0b\u1ecd\u0300 \u00f2 y\u1eb9\u0301 \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n\" reinforces the idea from the first phrase.\n2. It states that another person's adornment/decoration doesn't suit one, and borrowed trousers don't suit a person.\n3. This adds the dimension of appearance and social perception - borrowed finery doesn't enhance one's dignity.\n4. The repeated use of \"\u00f2 y\u1eb9\" (does not suit/fit) emphasizes the mismatch between borrowed items and the borrower.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase confirms the proverb is about authenticity and the importance of using what naturally belongs to you rather than borrowed possessions, which extends beyond physical fit to social appropriateness.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"Borrowed money does not suit one; borrowed trousers do not suit a person; if they don't fit one's legs they become awkward; one's own possessions are what truly suit one.\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb emphasizes authenticity and self-reliance. It uses the concrete imagery of ill-fitting borrowed trousers to illustrate the broader principle that borrowed possessions\u2014whether material goods or affected mannerisms\u2014never truly suit a person. The proverb warns against pretentiousness and living beyond one's means. In Yoruba culture, this reflects values of contentment, authenticity, and the importance of living within one's natural circumstances rather than putting on appearances with borrowed resources. The wisdom suggests that dignity comes from authenticity rather than pretense, and that one should take pride in what is genuinely one's own rather than depending on others' possessions.\n\n- **References:** Both similar phrases reinforce the central message about borrowed items not suiting the borrower, with specific mention of borrowed trousers (\u1e63\u00f2k\u00f2t\u00f2 \u00e0gb\u00e0b\u1ecd\u0300) as a tangible example that would resonate in everyday Yoruba life.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe proverb \"\u00c0-w\u00edn-n\u00e1-w\u00f3 \u00f2 y\u1eb9ni; \u00e0-gb\u00e0-b\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd \u1e63\u00f2k\u00f2t\u00f2 \u00f2 y\u1eb9 \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n; b\u00ed k\u00f2 f\u00fanni l\u1eb9\u0301s\u1eb9\u0300 a d\u00f2r\u00f2g\u00ed; oh"
