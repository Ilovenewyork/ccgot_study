  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00cc\u1e63\u1eb9\u0300 \u00f2 ti ib\u00eckan m\u00fa \u1eb9ni; \u00ecy\u00e0 \u00f2 tib\u00eckan j\u1eb9 \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n; b\u00ed o b\u00e1 r\u00ecnr\u00ecn \u00f2\u1e63\u00ec, b\u00ed o b\u00e1 oj\u00fa \u00ec\u1e63\u1eb9\u0301 w\u1ecd\u0300l\u00fa, igb\u00e1-k\u00fagb\u00e1 ni w\u1ecdn \u00f3 fi bu omi f\u00fan \u1eb9 mu.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"Ibi t\u00ed a ti m\u00fa \u1ecd\u0300l\u1eb9 \u00f2 k\u00fann\u00e1; ibi t\u00ed a ti m\u00fa al\u00e1gb\u00e1ra\u00e1 t\u00f3 oko-\u00f3 ro\" translates to \"The place where a lazy person is caught doesn't burn; the place where a strong person is caught that makes them work hard.\"\n2. This phrase suggests that consequences come to people based on their character and choices, not random circumstance.\n3. It emphasizes that lazy people are caught in situations that expose their laziness, while hardworking people face challenges that reveal their strength.\n4. This suggests our main proverb may also address how one's circumstances or behaviors lead to specific consequences.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase indicates that the main proverb likely concerns how one's conduct or situation determines how they are treated by others or by life circumstances.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Work/poverty doesn't catch a person from one place; suffering doesn't afflict a person from one place; if you walk in poverty, if you enter town with the face of poverty, they will use any kind of calabash to give you water to drink.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00ccgb\u00e0 wo ni M\u00e1k\u00f9\u00fa \u00f2 n\u00ed\u00ed k\u00fa? M\u00e1k\u00f9\u00fa \u00f2 m\u1ecd awo \u00f3 \u1e3fb\u00fa \u1ecdpa; M\u00e1k\u00f9\u00fa \u00f2 m\u1ecd \u00ecw\u1eb9\u0300 \u00f3 \u1e3fb\u1ecd\u0301 s\u00f3d\u00f2\" translates approximately to \"When will Makuu not die? Makuu doesn't know divination but takes the diviner's staff; Makuu doesn't know swimming but goes to the river.\"\n2. This phrase speaks about someone who engages in activities they're not qualified for or prepared for, inevitably leading to negative consequences.\n3. It suggests that actions have consequences, especially when one does not follow proper protocols or lacks necessary skills.\n4. This connects to our main proverb by reinforcing the idea that one's circumstances (like poverty) often result from their choices or behaviors.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase reinforces that the main proverb is about cause and effect - how one's actions and presentation in society determine how they will be treated.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Hardship doesn't suddenly befall a person from nowhere; suffering doesn't randomly afflict someone; if you walk around in poverty, if you enter town looking destitute, people will serve you water with whatever calabash they find.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that hardship and suffering don't usually happen by chance but are often the consequences of one's choices, behaviors, or presentation. The proverb specifically emphasizes that if you present yourself as poor or destitute (whether through appearance, behavior, or mindset), society will treat you accordingly - serving you water with any calabash rather than with honor or respect. In Yoruba culture, how one is served water (and in what vessel) indicates their social standing. The proverb warns against self-neglect and encourages people to carry themselves with dignity, as your self-presentation significantly influences how others treat you. It also contains wisdom about taking responsibility for one's circumstances rather than blaming external factors.\n\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce the proverb's central message about cause and effect in human circumstances. Similar Phrase 1 shows how people's character determines their challenges, while Similar Phrase 2 illustrates how improper actions lead to inevitable consequences.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThis Yoruba proverb teaches that our circumstances often reflect our choices and self-presentation. \"Hardship doesn't suddenly befall a person from nowhere; if you walk around looking destitute, people will serve you water with whatever calabash they find.\" In"
