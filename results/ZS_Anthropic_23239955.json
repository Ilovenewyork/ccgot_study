  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"You're called an elephant child, yet you can't lift it; are you the one who swallowed it?\"\n\nThe proverb is essentially criticizing someone who fails to live up to their reputation or ancestry. It suggests that if you claim a prestigious identity or association (like being the child of an elephant - something great or powerful), you should be able to demonstrate appropriate capabilities. The second part adds irony by asking if the person actually caused their own burden, highlighting the contradiction of claiming greatness while showing weakness."
