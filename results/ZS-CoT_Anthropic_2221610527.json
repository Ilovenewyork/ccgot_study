When you harm others, you may inadvertently harm yourself or those connected to you. It's similar to the English saying \"What goes around comes around\" - highlighting the interconnectedness of human actions and their consequences.\n\nThe English translation of this Yoruba proverb is: \"As one tears the cloth from behind, one is also tearing the cloth of the person in front.\""
