  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00ccb\u00e0j\u00e9\u0323 \u1ecdjo\u0301\u0323 kan \u00f2 t\u00e1n bo\u0300\u0323ro\u0300\u0323\" translates to \"The ruin of one day does not destroy a whole town\" in English. \n\nThis proverb conveys the idea that a single day of misfortune or a single event of damage is not enough to completely ruin or destroy an entire community or situation. It emphasizes resilience and the ability to recover from setbacks. The underlying message is that challenges or failures, no matter how significant they may seem at the moment, do not define the entirety of a situation or the future. There is always the possibility of rebuilding, healing, and moving forward."
