  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"E\u0323l\u00e9\u0323d\u00e8\u0323 \u00f2 m\u00e8\u0323y\u1eb9\" translates to \"The pig is not a bird\" in English. This proverb is used to convey the idea that certain things or people cannot change their inherent nature or characteristics. Just as a pig cannot become a bird, some things are fundamentally what they are, regardless of any attempts to alter or disguise them. It serves as a reminder to recognize and accept the true nature of things or people, rather than expecting them to be something they are not."
