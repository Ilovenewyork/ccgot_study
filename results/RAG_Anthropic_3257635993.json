  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n## Translation\n\"The place where we are being told stories before inheriting property, we should know that the inheritance there does not concern us.\"\n\n## Explanation\nThis Yoruba proverb speaks to recognizing one's true position in a situation. It suggests that if you are being kept at a distance (being told stories or given explanations) before accessing an inheritance, you should recognize that you're not actually meant to be a beneficiary.\n\nThe proverb teaches about recognizing subtle signs of exclusion. In Yoruba culture, inheritance typically passes directly to rightful heirs without extensive preliminaries. If someone is being given lengthy explanations or stories before receiving their inheritance, it's a sign they're being diplomatically sidelined.\n\nThe wisdom here is about understanding social cues and your true position in relationships - if you're being treated as an outsider regarding something you supposedly have rights to, you should recognize the reality of your situation rather than clinging to false hope."
