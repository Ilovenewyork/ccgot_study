It implies that the noise or action is not necessarily genuine but serves a purpose of distraction or deception.  \nInterim Insight: The proverb may involve actions that are not straightforward, where the surface action (scolding a child) is a means to achieve a different end (seeking information or reaction).\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation**  \n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.  \nTranslation: \"A wife who scolds another person's child wants to hear some information.\"\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection**  \nSimilar Phrase 2: On\u00ed\u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 t\u00f3 j\u00f3 t\u00ed k\u00f2 gb\u1ecdn y\u00e8\u0323r\u00ec: \u00e0b\u00f9k\u00f9-u \u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 ko\u0301\u0323; \u00e0b\u00f9k\u00f9 ara \u00e8\u0323 ni.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2**  \n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.  \nChain-of-Thought:  \n1.

It highlights the importance of intention and understanding behind actions, suggesting that actions done without proper context or respect can lead to personal disgrace.  \nInterim Insight: The proverb may emphasize the importance of intention and understanding in actions, where the act of scolding is not just about discipline but about uncovering hidden truths or intentions.\n\n**Final Synthesis:**  \n- Final Translation: \"A wife who scolds another person's child wants to hear some information.\"  \n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: The proverb suggests that actions, such as scolding, may have underlying motives beyond their apparent purpose. In this context, the wife\u2019s scolding is not merely about correcting behavior but is a strategic act to elicit information or reactions that reveal deeper truths or intentions."
