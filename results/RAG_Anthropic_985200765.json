  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\nThe proverb: \"Mo m\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1n\" lOr\u00f2-\u00f3 fi \u0144gb\u00e9 \u1ecdk\u00f9nrin.\n\n## Translation\n\"It is when a man says 'I know it all' that Oro (the deity) carries him away.\"\n\n## Explanation\nThis proverb is a warning against overconfidence and arrogance. In Yoruba traditional belief, Oro is a powerful and feared deity associated with ancestral spirits and secret societies. The proverb suggests that when a person becomes so confident that they believe they have nothing more to learn (\"I know it all\"), they become vulnerable to spiritual dangers or misfortune (symbolized by being carried away by Oro).\n\nThe deeper meaning conveys that excessive pride in one's knowledge often precedes a fall. It warns against intellectual arrogance and encourages humility and continued learning. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would be used to caution someone who is acting too confident or refusing to take advice from others.\n\nThe lesson is that no matter how knowledgeable we become, we should always maintain humility and recognize there is always more to learn."
