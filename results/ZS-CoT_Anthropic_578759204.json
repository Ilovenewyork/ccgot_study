  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down phrase by phrase:\n\n\"Mo d\u00e0gb\u00e0 mo d\u00e0g\u00f3\" - This means \"I have grown old, I have grown aged/mature\"\n\n\"ar\u00e9 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9\" - This refers to \"the playfulness/games of children\" or \"children's play\"\n\n\"\u00f2 t\u00e1n l\u00f3j\u00fa\u00f9 mi\" - This means \"has not ended in my eyes\" or \"I still appreciate/understand\"\n\nPutting it all together, the English translation would be:\n\n\"Though I have grown old, I still appreciate the playfulness of children.\"\n\nThe meaning behind this proverb is that despite aging, one should maintain connection with youthful energy and not lose the ability to understand or appreciate the enthusiasm and playfulness of the younger generation. It speaks to wisdom that includes maintaining perspective across generations."
