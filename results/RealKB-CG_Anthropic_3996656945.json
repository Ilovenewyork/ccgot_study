This similar phrase talks about how the Okoro tree is treated with respect and called a kola nut tree, and only the kola nuts that grow on it are sweet/valuable.\n2. It suggests a relationship between identity/designation and consequence - something is valued for what it produces, not just what it's called.\n3. This relates to our proverb about the lamp extinguisher by suggesting consequences come from actions, not declarations.\n\nInterim Insight: Both proverbs deal with natural consequences that follow from actions rather than intentions or declarations.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The wind that claims it will extinguish the lamp will burn itself.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eb8y\u1eb9 t\u00f3 fi ara w\u00e9 ig\u00fan, \u1eb9\u0300h\u00ecn \u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144s\u00f9n.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase states that \"a bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind a chicken coop\" - meaning a creature that overestimates its abilities or status will find itself in a humble position.\n2. It warns against overconfidence and pretending to be something you're not, as reality will eventually assert itself.\n3. This connects to our proverb about the wind and lamp - both warn about overestimating one's power and the natural consequences that follow.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverbs share a theme of natural justice - those who overestimate their abilities or make boastful claims will face consequences aligned with their true nature, not their pretensions.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The wind that boasts it will extinguish the lamp will only burn itself.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against empty boasting and overestimating one's abilities. Just as wind might intend to blow out a lamp but instead gets burned by coming too close to the flame, people who make grand claims beyond their capabilities often harm themselves in the process. The proverb teaches humility and self-awareness, encouraging people to recognize their limitations rather than making boastful claims that may lead to their own downfall. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the value placed on humility (\u00ecw\u00e0 p\u1eb9\u0300l\u1eb9\u0301) and the natural justice that follows when one acts contrary to their true nature or capacity.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reminds us that true value comes from what we produce, not what we claim to be. Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the lesson about false pretenses leading to humbling consequences.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0f\u00f2pin\u00e1 t\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 pa f\u00ect\u00edl\u00e0, ara \u1eb9\u0300 ni y\u00f3 pa\" translates to \"The wind that boasts it will extinguish the lamp will only burn itself.\" This proverb warns against empty boasting and overconfidence. In Yoruba wisdom, it teaches that those who overestimate their abilities and make grand claims often end up harming themselves instead. The natural consequence of the wind's interaction with fire parallels how human pretension often leads to self-inflicted damage. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of \u00ecw\u00e0 p\u1eb9\u0300l\u1eb9\u0301 (humility) and belief in natural justice - that the universe has a way of humbling those who fail to recognize their true place and limitations."
