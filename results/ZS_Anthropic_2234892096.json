  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Id\u00e0 ahun la fi \u0144pa ahun\" translates to English as:\n\n\"It is the tortoise's sword that is used to kill the tortoise.\"\n\nThis proverb conveys that a person's own weakness, words, or actions are often what lead to their downfall. Similar to the English expressions \"hoist by one's own petard\" or \"one's own weapon being used against them,\" it suggests that people are often defeated by their own devices or mistakes."
