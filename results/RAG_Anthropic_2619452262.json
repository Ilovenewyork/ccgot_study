The proverb suggests that with sufficient determination and energy (arm strength), even seemingly impossible tasks can be accomplished - to the point where something as delicate as cotton thread could cut through a tree.\n\n## Cultural Context:\nIn Yoruba culture, this proverb is used to encourage people to stop blaming their tools or circumstances for their failures. Instead, it urges people to look inward at their own commitment and effort level. It reflects the cultural value placed on determination, personal responsibility, and the belief that human willpower can overcome material limitations.\n\n## Usage:\nThis proverb might be used when someone complains about inadequate resources rather than focusing on what they can achieve with what they have. It serves as both encouragement and gentle admonishment to put in more effort rather than making excuses."
