  "gen": "English: The person with neck beads threaded them together; if the person with waist beads had money, it's not difficult to thread waist beads.\n\nThis proverb suggests that a person who has accomplished something (threading neck beads) makes it look easy, while implying that others (like those who wear waist beads) could do similar things if they had the resources (money). It speaks to how having means makes tasks easier, and how we shouldn't judge others' lack of accomplishment without considering their constraints."
