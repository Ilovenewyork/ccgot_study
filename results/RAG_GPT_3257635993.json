  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Ibi t\u00ed a ti \u0144p\u00ect\u00e0n k\u00e1 t\u00f3 jog\u00fan, k\u00e1 mo\u0300\u0323 p\u00e9 og\u00fan ib\u00e8\u0323 \u00f2 kanni\" can be translated to English as \"Before we start fighting over an inheritance, we should know that the inheritance is not ours.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb advises caution and wisdom before engaging in disputes or conflicts over something that may not rightfully belong to us. It suggests that one should first ascertain the legitimacy or ownership of what is being contested before getting involved in any arguments or battles over it. The underlying message is to avoid unnecessary conflicts by ensuring that one's claim or right to something is valid and justified."
