  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed \u00ecl\u00e0r\u00ed b\u00e1 f\u00e9\u0323 t\u00e9\u0323, a n\u00ed k\u00ed l\u1ecdba \u00f3 \u1e63e?\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **B\u00ed** - This means \"if\" in English.\n2. **\u00ecl\u00e0r\u00ed** - This refers to a \"royal servant\" or \"courtier\" in the Yoruba context.\n3. **b\u00e1 f\u00e9\u0323 t\u00e9\u0323** - \"b\u00e1 f\u00e9\u0323\" means \"wants to\" or \"intends to,\" and \"t\u00e9\u0323\" means \"sit.\" So, \"b\u00e1 f\u00e9\u0323 t\u00e9\u0323\" translates to \"wants to sit.\"\n4. **a n\u00ed** - This means \"we say\" or \"it is said.\"\n5. **k\u00ed l\u1ecdba \u00f3 \u1e63e?** - \"k\u00ed\" is a conjunction that can mean \"that\" or \"so that,\" \"l\u1ecdba\" means \"the king,\" \"\u00f3\" is a pronoun for \"he\" or \"it,\" and \"\u1e63e\" means \"do.\" So, \"k\u00ed l\u1ecdba \u00f3 \u1e63e?\" translates to \"what should the king do?\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb translates to: \"If a royal servant wants to sit, what should the king do?\"\n\nThis proverb suggests a situation where someone of lower status desires something that might be seen as inappropriate or presumptuous, and it questions how someone of higher status should respond. It highlights themes of hierarchy, respect, and the appropriate behavior expected within social structures."
