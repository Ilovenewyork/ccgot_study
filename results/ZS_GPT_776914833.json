  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed fi \u00ecka ro et\u00ed, k\u00e1 fi ro im\u00fa, k\u00e1 w\u00e1 t\u00fan fi ta eh\u00edn\" translates to English as \"One does not use a finger to measure the ear, then use it to measure the nose, and then use it to count the teeth.\" This proverb suggests that it is inappropriate or ineffective to use the same approach or method for different situations or tasks, as each requires its own specific consideration or tool."
