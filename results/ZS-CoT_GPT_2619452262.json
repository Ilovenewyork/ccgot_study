  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0\u00ec-l\u00e1p\u00e1 l\u00e0d\u00e1 \u00f2 m\u00fa; b\u00ed a b\u00e1 l\u00e1p\u00e1, \u1ecdm\u1ecd ow\u00fa to-o g\u00e9gi\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\u00c0\u00ec-l\u00e1p\u00e1**: This phrase means \"without effort\" or \"lack of effort.\"\n2. **l\u00e0d\u00e1 \u00f2 m\u00fa**: \"L\u00e0d\u00e1\" refers to a cutlass or machete, and \"\u00f2 m\u00fa\" means \"does not cut.\" So, this part means \"the cutlass does not cut.\"\n3. **b\u00ed a b\u00e1 l\u00e1p\u00e1**: \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1\" means \"if we\" or \"when we,\" and \"l\u00e1p\u00e1\" means \"put in effort\" or \"exert effort.\"\n4. **\u1ecdm\u1ecd ow\u00fa to-o g\u00e9gi**: \"\u1eccm\u1ecd ow\u00fa\" refers to \"a child of cotton\" or \"a cotton child,\" which metaphorically means someone who is soft or delicate. \"To-o g\u00e9gi\" means \"can cut wood.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as:\n\"Without effort, the cutlass does not cut; if we exert effort, even a delicate person can cut wood.\"\n\nThis proverb emphasizes the importance of effort and determination in achieving tasks, suggesting that with effort, even those who seem unlikely to succeed can accomplish difficult tasks."
