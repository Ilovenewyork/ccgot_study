  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down component by component:\n\n\"\u00c0\u00ec-k\u00fak\u00fa-joye\" - This means \"not having been installed as a king/chief\" or \"not ruling at all\"\n\"\u00f3 s\u00e0n ju\" - This means \"it is better than\"\n\"\u1eb8nu\u00f9 mi \u00f2 k\u00e1 \u00ecl\u00fa\" - This translates to \"my mouth/reign is not sufficient for the town\" or \"I couldn't handle the responsibilities of ruling the town\"\n\"l\u1ecd\" - This is a comparative marker, completing the \"better than\" structure\n\nPutting it together, the proverb means:\n\n\"It is better not to become a king at all than to admit that one couldn't handle the responsibilities of ruling.\"\n\nThe deeper meaning is that it's more honorable to avoid taking on a position of leadership than to take it and then fail or admit inadequacy. It speaks to the importance of knowing one's capabilities before accepting responsibilities, especially those involving leadership over others."
