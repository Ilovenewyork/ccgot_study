It speaks to situations where a person who has already suffered a loss (being sold) then complains about a secondary consequence (the suffering caused by the cutlass purchased with their money).\n\nEnglish translation:\n\"One who is sold and whose money is used to buy a cutlass complains that the cutlass is making them suffer.\""
