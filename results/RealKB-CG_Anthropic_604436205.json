This relates to how sacred things maintain their power by being set apart or not overly familiar.\n3. The phrase teaches about boundaries and respect in relationships, especially with authority figures or sacred entities.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests a cultural value that maintains respect requires some level of distance or boundary. This may inform our understanding of \"\u00c0g\u00f9nb\u00e1nir\u1ecd\u0300 n\u00ed \u0144foj\u00fadini\" as potentially dealing with relationships, boundaries, or respect.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A person who climbs onto another's back is the one who sees ahead.\" (\u00c0g\u00f9nb\u00e1 = one who climbs on back, nir\u1ecd\u0300 = on another, n\u00ed = is, \u0144foj\u00fadini = sees ahead)\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00ccp\u00e9\u01f9p\u00e9j\u00fa \u00f2 n\u00ed enini; \u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 ir\u00f9ngb\u1ecd\u0300n \u00f2 \u1e63e \u00f2l\u00f2\u00f3.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00ccp\u00e9\u01f9p\u00e9j\u00fa \u00f2 n\u00ed enini; \u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 ir\u00f9ngb\u1ecd\u0300n \u00f2 \u1e63e \u00f2l\u00f2\u00f3\" translates to \"A brief moment doesn't have depth; an elder with a gray beard isn't automatically wise.\" \n2. This proverb cautions against superficial judgments or assumptions based merely on appearances or status.\n3. It emphasizes that true wisdom or understanding comes from more than just external markers or position.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase adds the cultural nuance that position alone (like being an elder) doesn't guarantee wisdom. Similarly, in our target proverb, the person who climbs on another's back gains perspective not through their own merit but through their position relative to others.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The person who rides on another's back is the one who sees farther.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the advantages gained through relationships with others. It acknowledges that people achieve greater vision or perspective not solely through their own abilities but by \"standing on the shoulders\" of others. However, when paired with the context phrases, there's a deeper meaning: while those who leverage others may see farther, this position doesn't necessarily confer real wisdom or respect. The proverb can be used to comment on people who achieve visibility or advantage through others rather than their own merit. It serves as both an acknowledgment of interdependence in society and a subtle critique of those who use others for personal advancement.\n\n- References: The interpretation is informed by \"\u00c0k\u00ed\u00ecj\u1eb9\u0301 m\u00fa \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 n\u00edy\u00ec\" (respect requires distance) and \"\u00ccp\u00e9\u01f9p\u00e9j\u00fa \u00f2 n\u00ed enini; \u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 ir\u00f9ngb\u1ecd\u0300n \u00f2 \u1e63e \u00f2l\u00f2\u00f3\" (position alone doesn't guarantee wisdom)."
