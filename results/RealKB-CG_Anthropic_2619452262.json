  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00c0\u00ec-l\u00e1p\u00e1 l\u00e0d\u00e1 \u00f2 m\u00fa; b\u00ed a b\u00e1 l\u00e1p\u00e1, \u1ecdm\u1ecd ow\u00fa to-o g\u00e9gi.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Ibi t\u00ed a ti m\u00fa \u1ecd\u0300l\u1eb9 \u00f2 k\u00fann\u00e1; ibi t\u00ed a ti m\u00fa al\u00e1gb\u00e1ra\u00e1 t\u00f3 oko-\u00f3 ro\" translates to \"Where a lazy person is caught, there's no fire; where a strong person is caught, it's enough to till a farm.\"\n2. This phrase contrasts the capabilities of a lazy person versus a strong, energetic person, showing how energy and strength determine what can be accomplished.\n3. The contrast suggests that having strength/energy (\u00e1p\u00e1) is crucial for productivity, just as our main proverb mentions \"\u00e1p\u00e1\" (strength/arm).\n\nInterim Insight: Both phrases emphasize how physical capability and energy determine productivity. The similar phrase suggests that when someone has strength, they can accomplish significant tasks, while laziness results in minimal output.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"It is lack of strength that makes the machete not cut; if we have strength, a cotton plant is enough to cut a tree.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed ba\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300-\u1eb9\u0301 b\u00e1 \u0144t\u00e0k\u00ect\u00ec, \u00f2r\u00f3gi l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e1 \u1eb9m\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"If the head of the house is stomping/dancing vigorously, we use a tree trunk to respond to the rhythm.\"\n2. This proverb suggests that when a leader shows energy and enthusiasm, followers respond with even greater effort or commitment.\n3. It reinforces the idea that energy and strength (as in the main proverb) influence outcomes and determine what can be accomplished.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase adds the cultural value of energy begetting energy, and how determination can overcome apparent limitations. It's not just about physical strength but also about enthusiasm and commitment to a task.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It is lack of strength that makes the machete not cut; if we have strength, even a cotton plant is enough to cut a tree.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that limitations often come from lack of effort or determination rather than external circumstances. Just as a machete fails to cut not because it's blunt but because the wielder lacks strength, our failures may result from insufficient effort. The cotton plant (soft) cutting a tree (hard) is a powerful metaphor showing that with sufficient determination and energy, even seemingly inadequate tools can accomplish difficult tasks. The proverb emphasizes the Yoruba cultural value of diligence, perseverance, and the belief that human will and effort can overcome apparent limitations.\n\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce this interpretation by contrasting productivity with energy levels and showing how determination can transcend apparent limitations, reflecting the Yoruba emphasis on diligence and personal agency in achieving success.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe proverb \"\u00c0\u00ec-l\u00e1p\u00e1 l\u00e0d\u00e1 \u00f2 m\u00fa; b\u00ed a b\u00e1 l\u00e1p\u00e1, \u1ecdm\u1ecd ow\u00fa to-o g\u00e9gi\" translates to \"It is lack of strength that makes the machete not cut; if we have strength, even a cotton plant is enough to cut a tree.\" This proverb teaches that our limitations often stem from insufficient effort rather than external circumstances. In Yoruba culture, it emphasizes that with enough determination and energy, seemingly impossible tasks become achievable\u2014even using apparently inadequate tools (like cutting a tree with a soft cotton plant). This reflects the cultural values of diligence, perseverance, and the belief in human agency to overcome obstacles through sustained effort and determination."
