  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"A-lu-d\u00f9nd\u00fan k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1rin\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **A-lu-d\u00f9nd\u00fan**: This term refers to someone who is boastful or someone who makes a lot of noise about their achievements or possessions. It can be likened to a braggart or someone who is full of themselves.\n\n2. **k\u00ec \u00ed**: This phrase means \"does not\" or \"never.\" It is used to indicate a negation or something that does not happen.\n\n3. **d\u00e1rin**: This word means \"to laugh\" or \"to smile.\" It refers to the act of showing amusement or happiness through laughter.\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb \"A-lu-d\u00f9nd\u00fan k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1rin\" can be translated to English as: \"A boastful person does not laugh.\" \n\nThis proverb suggests that those who are overly boastful or full of themselves often do not find genuine joy or amusement, as they are too focused on their own self-importance."
