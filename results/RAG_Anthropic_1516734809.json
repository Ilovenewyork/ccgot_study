It means that a father (or parent) should not abandon his responsibilities and shift them to his children. Parents should handle their own obligations rather than passing their burdens to their children.\n\nThe proverb speaks to the cultural value in Yoruba society of proper parental roles and responsibilities. It can be applied in situations where:\n\n1. A parent tries to make their children solve problems they should be handling themselves\n2. Elders attempt to shift their responsibilities to younger generations\n3. Leaders attempt to blame subordinates for their own failings\n\nIt's a call for people, especially those in authority, to take responsibility for their actions and duties rather than passing them on to those under their care."
