The phrase \"A-d\u00e1-m\u00e1-l\u00e8-\u1e63e\" means \"one who creates but cannot accomplish\" or \"one who cannot do what they claim,\" while \"\u00e0d\u00e0b\u00e0 t\u00ed \u0144d\u00fan b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" refers to a dove making a distinctive cooing sound.\n\nThe proverb criticizes people who are all talk and no action - those who make a lot of noise about what they will do but never actually follow through. It's similar to English expressions like \"all bark and no bite\" or \"empty vessels make the most noise.\"\n\nIn Yoruba culture, this proverb serves as a warning against idle boasting and encourages people to let their actions speak rather than just their words."
