  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u1eb8n\u00ed b\u00e1 d\u1eb9 oj\u00fa-u r\u1eb9\u0300 s\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300 \u00e1 r\u00edm\u00fa-u r\u1eb9\u0300.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00c0\u00ec-l\u00e8-j\u00e0 ni \u00e0 \u0144s\u1ecd p\u00e9 'Oj\u00fade baba-\u00e0 mi \u00f2 d\u00e9 \u00ech\u00edn'\" translates roughly to \"It is inability to fight that makes one say 'My father's courtyard does not extend to here.'\"\n2. This suggests making excuses for not confronting challenges, essentially indicating that people often create justifications for their limitations.\n3. The similar phrase reveals a cultural emphasis on recognizing pretexts used to avoid responsibility or confrontation.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that the main proverb may also deal with evasion, excuses, or confronting reality directly rather than avoiding it.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Whoever looks down (casts their eyes to the ground) will find their nose.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed oj\u00fa b\u00e1 r\u00ed, \u1eb9nu a d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"When the eyes see, the mouth becomes silent.\"\n2. This second phrase emphasizes how direct observation (using one's eyes) brings clarity that renders arguments or denial (the mouth's function) unnecessary.\n3. It suggests that confronting reality directly leads to understanding and acceptance.\n4. Both phrases share the theme of sensory organs (eyes, mouth, nose) as metaphors for perception and truth.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces the idea that the main proverb is about the relationship between perception, attention, and discovering obvious truths that are part of oneself.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One who looks down will find their nose.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that self-reflection leads to self-discovery. Just as your nose is always in your field of vision but you may not notice it until you consciously look down, the solutions to problems or self-knowledge are often already within your reach. The proverb encourages introspection and suggests that many answers we seek externally are actually part of us already. It also carries the subtle message that one doesn't need to search far and wide for something that is inherently part of oneself. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the value placed on self-awareness and recognizing one's own capabilities rather than making excuses (as reflected in Similar Phrase 1) or seeking external validation when the truth is already evident (as reflected in Similar Phrase 2).\n\n- References: The interpretation is informed by Similar Phrase 1 which warns against making excuses, and Similar Phrase 2 which emphasizes how direct observation reveals truth.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8n\u00ed b\u00e1 d\u1eb9 oj\u00fa-u r\u1eb9\u0300 s\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300 \u00e1 r\u00edm\u00fa-u r\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"One who looks down will find their nose.\" It teaches that self-reflection leads to self-discovery and that many solutions we seek are already within our reach, just as our nose is always in our field of vision. This proverb encourages introspection and recognizing one's inherent capabilities rather than seeking external answers or making excuses for not confronting one's reality."
