  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"B\u00ed eegb\u1ecd\u0301n b\u00e1 \u1e63o ay\u00ednr\u00edn n\u00edm\u00fa, ad\u00ec\u1eb9 k\u1ecd\u0301 ni y\u00f3 ja.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. Similar Phrase 1 \"B\u00ed eegb\u1ecd\u0301n b\u00e1 so m\u1ecd\u0301 aj\u00e1 l\u1eb9\u0301nu, ak\u00e1t\u00e1 l\u00e0 \u0144n\u00ed k\u00f3 j\u00e1 a?\" translates roughly as \"If an elder ties something to a dog's mouth, is it a cat we ask to untie it?\"\n2. This phrase uses animal imagery (dog and cat) to represent hierarchy and appropriate responsibility.\n3. It suggests that problems created by elders should be solved by those with appropriate authority or capability, not by subordinates.\n4. The structure follows the same pattern as our target proverb: \"If an elder does X, is Y the appropriate one to address it?\"\n\nInterim Insight: This suggests our target proverb likely deals with hierarchy, appropriate responsibility, and possibly the limitations of challenging authority.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"If an elder puts sand in his nose, is it a chicken that will remove it?\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. Similar Phrase 2 \"B\u00ed \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e1n b\u00e1 n\u00ed k\u00f2 s\u00ed ir\u00fa \u00f2un, \u00e0w\u1ecdn \u1ecdl\u1ecdgb\u1ecd\u0301n a m\u00e1a w\u00f2ye\" translates roughly as \"If someone claims there is no one like them, the wise will observe quietly.\"\n2. This phrase suggests wisdom in restraint when confronted with arrogance or inappropriate behavior from others.\n3. It emphasizes the value of patience and observation rather than direct confrontation.\n4. This adds the dimension of wisdom in choosing one's battles, especially with those who may be superior in status.\n\nInterim Insight: Our target proverb likely advises against inappropriate challenges to authority, suggesting wisdom in knowing one's place in the social hierarchy and recognizing when intervention is not your responsibility.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"If an elder puts sand in his nose, is it a chicken that will remove it?\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of respecting social hierarchy and understanding appropriate boundaries of responsibility. It suggests that when a person of higher status or authority (the elder) creates a problem for themselves (putting sand in their nose), it is not the place of someone with lower status or capability (the chicken) to attempt to solve it or confront them. The proverb teaches wisdom in knowing one's place, not interfering in matters beyond one's station, and recognizing that some problems should be solved by those who created them or by others with appropriate standing. In Yoruba culture, which values respect for elders and proper social conduct, this proverb would serve as a reminder about appropriate social boundaries and the wisdom of restraint.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of appropriate responsibility based on status. Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of wisdom in observing rather than confronting those who act inappropriately."
