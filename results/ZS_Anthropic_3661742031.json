  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to:\n\n\"What did Daaro have before claiming to have been robbed?\"\n\nThe proverb essentially questions what possessions a person actually had before claiming theft - suggesting skepticism about someone complaining about losing something they may never have possessed in the first place. It's often used to call into question exaggerated claims of loss or to point out that someone is complaining about losing something they never truly owned."
