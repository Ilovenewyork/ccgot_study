  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"A\u00e1y\u00e1n ati e\u00e8r\u00e0\u00e1 \u1e63\u00edgun, wo\u0301\u0323n n\u00ed \u00e0wo\u0301\u0323n \u0144l\u1ecd m\u00fa ad\u00ec\u1eb9 \u00e0l\u1ecd la r\u00ed, a \u00f2 r\u00e1bo\u0300\u0323\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **A\u00e1y\u00e1n ati e\u00e8r\u00e0\u00e1 \u1e63\u00edgun**: This part refers to \"termites and ants digging.\"\n\n2. **wo\u0301\u0323n n\u00ed \u00e0wo\u0301\u0323n \u0144l\u1ecd m\u00fa ad\u00ec\u1eb9 \u00e0l\u1ecd la r\u00ed**: This translates to \"they said they were going to catch a chicken that strayed.\"\n\n3. **a \u00f2 r\u00e1bo\u0300\u0323**: This means \"we did not see the sacrifice.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as: \"The termites and ants were digging, they said they were going to catch a chicken that strayed, but we did not see the sacrifice.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that sometimes people claim to be working towards a goal or solving a problem, but the expected results or evidence of their efforts are not visible."
