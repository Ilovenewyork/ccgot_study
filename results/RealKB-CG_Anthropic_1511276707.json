  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 iw\u1ecd; \u1ecd\u0300m\u1ecd\u0300r\u00e0n n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 ob\u00ec; m\u00e0r\u00ed-m\u00e0j\u1eb9 n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 aw\u00f9s\u00e1.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa-u p\u00f3\u0144p\u00f3l\u00e0, og\u00e9 kun os\u00f9n l\u00e1\u00ecw\u1eb9\" roughly translates to \"The person who loves elegance/beauty uses red camwood without bathing first\" or \"The dandy uses camwood without bathing\"\n2. This refers to someone who is concerned with appearances but neglects the fundamentals or proper order of things\n3. \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa\" appears in both phrases, suggesting our proverb relates to people who are particular, elegant, or fastidious\n4. The similar phrase indicates that in Yoruba culture, there's recognition of people who have specific tastes or preferences, sometimes to their detriment\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely addresses how different personality types have different preferences or tastes, with \"af\u00ednj\u00fa\" referring to someone fastidious or particular about elegance and appearances.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The fastidious/elegant person eats iw\u1ecd (a type of vegetable); the wise/knowledgeable person eats kola nut; the impulsive/hasty person eats alligator pepper.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0fi ohun t\u00ed a k\u00ec \u00ed t\u00e0 l\u1ecd\u0301j\u00e0 l\u1eb9r\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\" translates to \"Only what is not sold in the market is what a slave cannot eat\" or \"A slave can only not eat what is not available in the market\"\n2. This second phrase speaks to limitations of choice or access based on social position\n3. It suggests that people's consumption or preferences are sometimes constrained by their circumstances or status\n4. When connected to our main proverb, it reinforces the idea that different types of people naturally gravitate toward different things\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb describes how people's choices or preferences are tied to their character or nature. Just as a slave can only access what's in the market, different personality types naturally gravitate toward certain foods or experiences that align with their character.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The fastidious person eats iw\u1ecd (vegetable); the wise person eats kola nut; the impulsive person eats alligator pepper.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb observes how people's preferences and choices reflect their fundamental character. The fastidious or elegant person (af\u00ednj\u00fa) chooses iw\u1ecd, a vegetable that requires careful preparation. The wise or knowledgeable person (\u1ecd\u0300m\u1ecd\u0300r\u00e0n) favors kola nut, which is associated with wisdom, ritual, and thoughtful social interaction in Yoruba culture. The impulsive or hasty person (m\u00e0r\u00ed-m\u00e0j\u1eb9) prefers alligator pepper, which provides immediate, strong sensation. The proverb teaches that our choices reveal our character, and different personalities naturally gravitate toward different things that suit their nature.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 highlights the importance of character and appearances in Yoruba culture. Similar Phrase 2 emphasizes how choices are connected to one's station or nature in life.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe proverb \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 iw\u1ecd; \u1ecd\u0300m\u1ecd\u0300r\u00e0n n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 ob\u00ec; m\u00e0r\u00ed-m\u00e0j\u1eb9 n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 aw\u00f9s\u00e1\" translates to \"The fastidious person eats iw\u1ecd; the wise person eats kola nut; the impulsive person eats alligator pepper.\" It reveals how our preferences reflect our character: the particular person chooses foods requiring careful preparation, the wise person favors the culturally significant kola nut associated with thoughtful ritual, and the impulsive person gravitates toward the immediate sensation of spicy alligator pepper. In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb teaches that our choices naturally align with and reveal our fundamental nature."
