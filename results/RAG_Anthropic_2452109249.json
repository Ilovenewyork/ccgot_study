  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n**Literal translation:** \"What meat have we not eaten before? The frog met us wearing shoes, but now it's naked/unadorned.\"\n\n**Meaning:** This proverb expresses the idea that we should not be surprised by changes in fortune or circumstances. It uses the humorous image of a frog that was once wearing shoes (representing prosperity or high status) but is now seen in its natural, unadorned state.\n\n**Explanation:** The proverb teaches about the impermanence of status and wealth. It suggests that one should not be shocked when someone who was once prosperous falls on hard times, or when something that seemed impressive is revealed to be ordinary. It encourages people to maintain perspective about life's ups and downs, recognizing that circumstances often change. The saying also implies that we've experienced many things in life (\"what meat have we not eaten?\"), so we shouldn't be surprised by reversals of fortune.\n\nThis proverb is often used when discussing someone who has fallen from a position of wealth or status, or when something that appeared special is revealed to be common."
