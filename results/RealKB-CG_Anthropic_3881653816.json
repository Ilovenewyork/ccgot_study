The similar phrase \"\u1eb8ni \u00e0 b\u00e1 t\u00e0 k\u00e1 fow\u00f3-o r\u1eb9\u0300 ra \u00e0t\u00f9p\u00e0: \u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00e0-j\u00ed-tann\u00e1-w\u00f2-l\u00f3ru\" appears to follow the same structure as our target proverb.\n2. This phrase involves someone being sold, with the money used to buy a lamp (\u00e0t\u00f9p\u00e0), and then the person claiming they'll be waking up to light the lamp at night.\n3. The structure suggests irony - someone in a bad situation (being sold into slavery) yet claiming they'll have a responsibility or burden (lighting lamps at night).\n4. This helps understand that the proverb likely deals with ironic situations where someone suffers a major loss yet focuses on a minor inconvenience.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb uses the literary device of irony to comment on human tendency to miss the bigger picture when facing hardship.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The person who is sold and the money is used to buy a machete: he says the machete is causing him suffering.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The second similar phrase \"\u1eb8ni \u00e0 b\u00e1 t\u00e0 k\u00e1 fow\u00f3-o r\u1eb9\u0300 ra \u00e8b\u00f9: \u00f3 n\u00ed \u00e8l\u00e9 \u00f2\u00fan k\u00f3 \u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301d\u00fanr\u00fan\" continues the pattern of irony.\n2. Here, someone is sold and the money is used to buy yams (\u00e8b\u00f9), and then the person complains about having to count five hundred yams.\n3. This reinforces the theme of misplaced concern - being more worried about a minor inconvenience (counting yams) than the major tragedy (being sold).\n4. Both similar phrases help establish that the proverb is about someone who misses the fundamental problem while focusing on a trivial consequence.\n\nInterim Insight: These proverbs use dramatic irony to highlight how people sometimes focus on minor inconveniences while ignoring catastrophic situations affecting them.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The person who is sold and the money is used to buy a machete: he says the machete is causing him suffering.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb uses irony to criticize people who miss the main issue while complaining about a minor consequence. The person in the proverb has been sold into slavery (a catastrophic life event), yet is concerned about the suffering caused by the machete that was purchased with the money from their sale. The proverb teaches about proper perspective and priorities - warning against focusing on trivial matters while ignoring the fundamental problems. In Yoruba wisdom tradition, this reflects the importance of clear thinking and proper assessment of one's situation. It can be applied to situations where people misidentify the true source of their problems or fail to recognize the gravity of their circumstances.\n\n- References: The pattern is consistent across all three examples - someone is sold, the money buys something (machete/lamp/yams), and then the person complains about a minor issue related to that item rather than the fact they were sold into slavery.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8ni \u00e0 b\u00e1 t\u00e0 k\u00e1 fow\u00f3-o r\u1eb9\u0300 ra \u00e0d\u00e1: \u00f3 n\u00ed \u00ecy\u00e0 \u00e0d\u00e1 \u0144j\u1eb9 \u00f2un\" translates to \"The person who is sold and the money is used to buy a machete: he says the machete is causing him suffering.\" It criticizes the human tendency to focus on minor inconveniences while ignoring major calamities. The profound irony in the proverb serves as a teaching tool about maintaining proper perspective in life and correctly identifying the true source of one's problems."
