  "gen": "English: Your younger sibling is making clothes for you, and you complain that they're not using el\u00e9kuru (fine fabric); who is wearing al\u00e1k\u00e0r\u00e0 (coarse fabric)?\n\nThis proverb suggests that when someone is doing you a favor (like making clothes), it's ungrateful to complain about the quality. It cautions against being overly critical of gifts or help received, especially when you're not in a position to be choosy. The message is about appreciating what others do for you rather than finding fault with their generosity."
