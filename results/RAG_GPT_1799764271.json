  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c8\u0323wo\u0300\u0323n t\u00f3 t\u00f3 o\u0300\u0323p\u1eb9 \u00f2 t\u00f3-\u00f3 d\u00e1 erin d\u00far\u00f3; \u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00ed erin m\u00e1 r\u00f2k\u00e8 o\u0300\u0323d\u00e0n, t\u00f2un terin n\u00ed \u0144l\u1ecd\" can be translated to English as: \"The chain that is tied to the palm tree is not strong enough to stop the elephant; the rope that tells the elephant not to climb the savannah, it is the elephant that decides where it goes.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis proverb uses the imagery of an elephant, a symbol of great strength and determination, and a chain or rope, which represents constraints or limitations. The message conveyed is that certain forces or constraints are not strong enough to stop someone or something that is determined and powerful. It emphasizes the idea that true strength and determination cannot be easily hindered by external limitations or obstacles. The elephant, representing a powerful force, will go where it wants, regardless of the attempts to restrain it. This can be applied to human situations where individuals or entities with strong will and determination are not easily stopped by challenges or restrictions."
