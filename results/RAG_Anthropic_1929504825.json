  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:** \"Only what is not sold in the market is what a slave cannot eat.\"\n\n**Meaning:** This proverb means that a slave can eat anything that is available in the market or anything that is commonly accessible. The only foods a slave cannot access are those that are not even available for sale in the marketplace.\n\n**Deeper explanation:** \nThis proverb speaks to the limited restrictions on what enslaved people could consume in traditional Yoruba society. While slaves had a lower social status, their basic needs like food were generally met with whatever was commonly available. The proverb ironically highlights that slaves weren't restricted from common foods - only from things so rare or precious that they couldn't even be found in the marketplace.\n\nIn contemporary usage, this proverb can be applied to situations where people claim they're being denied something that isn't actually available to anyone. It reminds us that some limitations affect everyone equally, not just those in disadvantaged positions."
