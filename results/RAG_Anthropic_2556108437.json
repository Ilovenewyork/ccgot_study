Just as soup that's being overcooked or burning on the fire will cause immediate reaction and conversation among those present, problems or uncomfortable situations tend to bring hidden issues to light.\n\nThe proverb speaks to how adversity often forces people to address matters they might otherwise avoid. When something goes wrong (the soup burning), people can no longer remain silent\u2014they must speak up and address the situation directly.\n\nThis is similar to the other proverbs you shared, which also deal with how circumstances affect communication: the second refers to how a thief's mother cannot speak comfortably about certain topics, and the third suggests that when eyes witness something, the mouth becomes quiet (in shock or because evidence speaks for itself)."
