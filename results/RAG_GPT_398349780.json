  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"A-lu-d\u00f9nd\u00fan k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1rin\" can be translated to \"One who beats the dundun drum does not dance.\" \n\nExplanation: In Yoruba culture, the dundun is a type of talking drum that is often used in musical performances. The proverb suggests that a person who is responsible for a particular task or role (in this case, playing the drum) cannot simultaneously engage in another activity that requires their full attention (such as dancing). It highlights the importance of focus and dedication to one's responsibilities. The broader implication is that one should concentrate on their primary duties and not get distracted by other activities that could compromise their effectiveness."
