  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Aj\u00e1 k\u00ec \u00ed l\u1ecd s\u00e1ginj\u00f9 l\u1ecd \u1e63\u1ecdd\u1eb9 \u1eb9k\u00f9n\" translates to \"A dog does not go into the wilderness to hunt a leopard.\" \n\nThis proverb conveys the idea of knowing one's limits and not overstepping boundaries. It suggests that one should not take on challenges or tasks that are beyond their capability or strength. Just as it would be unwise for a dog to venture into the wilderness to hunt a much stronger and more dangerous animal like a leopard, it is similarly unwise for a person to engage in endeavors that are beyond their capacity to handle. The proverb emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and prudence in decision-making."
