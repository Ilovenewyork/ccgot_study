  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eccjo\u0301\u0323 \u00e0gb\u00e0-\u00e1 k\u00fa s\u00e0n ju \u1ecdjo\u0301\u0323 \u00e0gb\u00e0-\u00e1 t\u00e9\u0323\" translates to \"The day an elder dies is better than the day an elder is disgraced.\" \n\nThis proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining dignity and respect throughout one's life. In Yoruba culture, elders are highly respected, and their wisdom and experience are valued. The proverb suggests that it is preferable for an elder to pass away with their honor intact rather than live to see a day when they are humiliated or lose their respect in the community. It underscores the value placed on honor and the legacy one leaves behind, highlighting that a dignified end is more honorable than a life that ends in disgrace."
