ZeroShot-CoT,GPT,"Ìṣẹ̀ ò ti ibìkan mú ẹni; ìyà ò tibìkan jẹ èèyàn; bí o bá rìnrìn òṣì, bí o bá ojú ìṣẹ́ wọ̀lú, igbá-kúgbá ni wọn ó fi bu omi fún ẹ mu.","Destitution does not attach to one at a particular place; suffering does not attack a person at a particular place; if one walks like a wretch into a town, if one looks like a loser when one enters a town, it is with a miserable calabash that the people will offer one water to drink.","To translate the Yoruba proverb into English, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Ìṣẹ̀ ò ti ibìkan mú ẹni**: 
   - ""Ìṣẹ̀"" means ""poverty"" or ""hardship.""
   - ""ò ti ibìkan mú"" means ""does not hold anyone from one place.""
   - ""ẹni"" means ""a person"" or ""anyone.""
   - So, this part translates to ""Poverty does not hold anyone from one place.""

2. **ìyà ò tibìkan jẹ èèyàn**: 
   - ""ìyà"" means ""suffering"" or ""hardship.""
   - ""ò tibìkan jẹ"" means ""does not consume from one place.""
   - ""èèyàn"" means ""a person"" or ""people.""
   - This translates to ""Suffering does not consume a person from one place.""

3. **bí o bá rìnrìn òṣì, bí o bá ojú ìṣẹ́ wọ̀lú**: 
   - ""bí o bá"" means ""if you.""
   - ""rìnrìn òṣì"" means ""walk in poverty.""
   - ""ojú ìṣẹ́"" means ""face hardship.""
   - ""wọ̀lú"" means ""enter a town"" or ""arrive in a town.""
   - This translates to ""if you walk in poverty, if you face hardship and enter a town.""

4. **igbá-kúgbá ni wọn ó fi bu omi fún ẹ mu**: 
   - ""igbá-kúgbá"" refers to a ""small calabash"" or ""small bowl.""
   - ""ni wọn ó fi bu omi fún ẹ mu"" means ""they will use to fetch water for you to drink.""
   - This translates to ""they will use a small calabash to fetch water for you to drink.""

Putting it all together, the proverb can be translated as:
""Poverty does not hold anyone from one place; suffering does not consume a person from one place. If you walk in poverty and face hardship when you enter a town, they will use a small calabash to fetch water for you to drink.""

This proverb suggests that hardship and poverty are not permanent states tied to a specific location, and when you encounter them, people may offer only minimal assistance."
ZeroShot-CoT,GPT,"Oòrùn, kó tìẹ wọ̀ ká má bàá Ọlọ́jọ́ wí.","Sun, go set so one does not blame the owner of the day.","To translate the Yoruba proverb ""Oòrùn, kó tìẹ wọ̀ ká má bàá Ọlọ́jọ́ wí"" into English, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Oòrùn**: This means ""the sun"" in English.
2. **kó tìẹ wọ̀**: This phrase can be translated as ""let it set"" or ""let it go down.""
3. **ká má bàá**: This means ""so that we do not"" or ""lest we.""
4. **Ọlọ́jọ́ wí**: ""Ọlọ́jọ́"" refers to ""the owner of the day"" or ""the creator of the day,"" which is often a reference to God or a higher power. ""wí"" means ""speak"" or ""complain.""

Putting it all together, the proverb can be translated to: ""Sun, set so that we do not incur the displeasure of the Creator of the day.""

This proverb suggests the idea of respecting natural order and divine timing, implying that certain things should happen at their appointed time to maintain harmony and avoid divine displeasure."
ZeroShot-CoT,GPT,"Mo dàgbà mo dàgó, aré ọmọdé ò tán lójúù mi.","I have become old and wise, but childish play has not ceased to appeal to me.","To translate the Yoruba proverb ""Mo dàgbà mo dàgó, aré ọmọdé ò tán lójúù mi"" into English, let's break it down step by step:

1. **""Mo dàgbà""** - This phrase means ""I have grown"" or ""I have matured."" It indicates that the speaker has gained experience or wisdom over time.

2. **""mo dàgó""** - This can be interpreted as ""I have become wise"" or ""I have become knowledgeable."" It suggests that the speaker has not only grown in age but also in understanding and insight.

3. **""aré ọmọdé""** - ""Aré"" means ""friend"" or ""companion,"" and ""ọmọdé"" means ""child"" or ""youth."" Together, ""aré ọmọdé"" can be understood as ""childhood friends"" or ""youthful companions.""

4. **""ò tán lójúù mi""** - ""Ò tán"" means ""are not finished"" or ""are not exhausted,"" and ""lójúù mi"" means ""in my eyes"" or ""in my view."" This part of the proverb suggests that the speaker still values or holds onto their youthful friendships or perspectives.

Putting it all together, the proverb can be translated to:

""I have grown and become wise, yet the friendships of my youth are not lost on me.""

This proverb emphasizes the idea that even as one matures and gains wisdom, the connections and friendships from one's youth remain significant and cherished."
ZeroShot-CoT,GPT,Olóbìnrin kan kì í pagbo ìja.,A person who has only  one wife does not form a circle for a fight.,"To translate the Yoruba proverb ""Olóbìnrin kan kì í pagbo ìja"" into English, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Olóbìnrin kan**: This phrase means ""a woman"" or ""one woman."" ""Olóbìnrin"" translates to ""woman,"" and ""kan"" means ""one"" or ""a.""

2. **kì í**: This is a negative construction in Yoruba, meaning ""does not"" or ""never.""

3. **pagbo ìja**: The word ""pagbo"" means ""to separate"" or ""to settle,"" and ""ìja"" means ""fight"" or ""dispute.""

Putting it all together, the proverb ""Olóbìnrin kan kì í pagbo ìja"" translates to ""A woman does not settle a dispute"" or ""One woman does not settle a fight.""

This proverb suggests that resolving conflicts often requires more than one person's effort or that it may not be traditionally expected for a woman to settle disputes alone."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ojú ò rọ́lá rí; ó bímọ ẹ̀ ó sọ ọ́ ní Ọláníyọnu.,A person only newly acquainted with wealth; he has a son and names him Ọlaniyọnu.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1. Breaking down the components:
   - ""Ojú ò rọ́lá rí"" - The eye has never seen honor/wealth
   - ""ó bímọ"" - it gave birth to a child
   - ""ẹ̀ ó sọ ọ́ ní Ọláníyọnu"" - and named the child Ọláníyọnu (a name that contains ""ọlá"" meaning honor/wealth)

2. Understanding the meaning:
   - This is about someone who has never experienced honor or wealth
   - Yet this person names their child with a name suggesting honor or wealth
   - ""Ọláníyọnu"" appears to be a name meaning something like ""honor/wealth is sweet"" or ""honor fills the mouth""

3. The full translation:
   ""The eye has never seen honor/wealth, yet it gives birth to a child and names it 'Honor is sweet.'""

4. The deeper meaning:
   This proverb speaks to irony or presumption - someone who has no experience with wealth or honor yet names their child as if they do. It comments on people who claim or aspire to things they haven't actually experienced."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ìwọ̀n eku nìwọ̀n ìtẹ́; olongo kì í gbé tìmùtìmù.,The measure of the rat is the measure of the nest; a robin does not live on a cushion.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the proverb:
""Ìwọ̀n eku nìwọ̀n ìtẹ́; olongo kì í gbé tìmùtìmù.""

Breaking down the components:
- ""Ìwọ̀n"" means ""size"" or ""measure""
- ""eku"" refers to a mouse or rat
- ""nìwọ̀n"" means ""is the same as"" or ""corresponds to""
- ""ìtẹ́"" means ""nest"" or ""burrow""
- ""olongo"" refers to a lizard
- ""kì í gbé"" means ""does not live in"" or ""does not occupy""
- ""tìmùtìmù"" describes something small or cramped

Putting it together, the literal translation is:
""The size of the rat corresponds to the size of the nest; a lizard does not live in a cramped space.""

The English equivalent and meaning:
""The size of the rat matches the size of its nest; a lizard doesn't dwell in a tight space.""

This proverb teaches about proper fit and suitability. It suggests that things should be appropriately matched according to their nature and capacity - everyone should operate within their natural capacity and environment."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ẹyẹ tó fi ara wé igún, ẹ̀hìn àdìrò ní ńsùn.",Whatever bird emulates the vulture will find itself behind the cooking hearth.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb into English step by step:

First, let me analyze the key words:
- ""Ẹyẹ"" = bird
- ""tó fi ara wé"" = that compares itself to
- ""igún"" = vulture
- ""ẹ̀hìn àdìrò"" = behind the chicken coop/hen house
- ""ní ńsùn"" = sleeps/will sleep

Putting these elements together:
""Ẹyẹ tó fi ara wé igún, ẹ̀hìn àdìrò ní ńsùn.""
Translates to:
""A bird that compares itself to a vulture will end up sleeping behind the chicken coop.""

The meaning of this proverb is about appropriate self-assessment and ambition. It warns against pretending to be something you're not or aspiring beyond your capabilities. The vulture soars high in the sky, while the bird that merely pretends to have such status ends up in a humble place (behind the chicken coop).

In English, we might express a similar sentiment with phrases like ""Don't get too big for your boots"" or ""Know your place."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Àwúrèbeé ní òún lè yẹ̀nà; ta ní jẹ́ tọ ọ̀nà àwúrèbe?,Àwúrebe says it can make a path; who would wish to follow a path it makes?,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1. Breaking down the proverb:
   - ""Àwúrèbeé"" refers to a cricket or grasshopper
   - ""ní òún lè yẹ̀nà"" means ""says it can clear/make a path""
   - ""ta ní jẹ́ tọ ọ̀nà àwúrèbe?"" means ""who would follow the path of a cricket/grasshopper?""

2. Understanding the literal meaning:
   The cricket/grasshopper claims it can clear a path, but who would follow the path made by a cricket/grasshopper?

3. Interpreting the meaning:
   This proverb is about credibility and leadership. It questions why anyone would follow guidance or direction from someone insignificant or incapable of creating a meaningful path.

English translation:
""The cricket claims it can clear a path; who would follow the path made by a cricket?""

The proverb cautions against following unreliable leaders or taking advice from those who lack the capacity to provide proper guidance."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Má tẹ̀ẹ́ lọ́wọ́ oníle, má tẹ̀ẹ́ lọ́wọ́ àlejò; lọ́wọ́ ara ẹni la ti ńtẹ́.","Save face with members of your household and save face with complete strangers, such a person loses face with himself/herself.","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb into English by analyzing it step by step.

First, let me break down the Yoruba words and phrases:
- ""Má tẹ̀ẹ́ lọ́wọ́ oníle"" = Don't depend on/rely on the landlord/homeowner
- ""má tẹ̀ẹ́ lọ́wọ́ àlejò"" = Don't depend on/rely on the visitor/guest
- ""lọ́wọ́ ara ẹni la ti ńtẹ́"" = One should depend on/rely on oneself

The verb ""tẹ̀"" in Yoruba refers to leaning on or depending on something/someone.

Putting it all together, the English translation would be:

""Don't depend on the landlord, don't depend on the guest; one should depend on oneself.""

This proverb emphasizes self-reliance and independence, suggesting that one shouldn't count on others (whether they're in positions of power like a landlord or temporary like a guest) but should instead trust in one's own abilities and resources."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Eégún ju eégún; òrìṣá ju òrìṣà; Pààká lé oníṣàngó wọ̀gbẹ́.,Some masqueraders are greater than others; some gods are greater than others; the masquerader Pààká chases the Ṣàngó worshipper into the bush.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1. ""Eégún ju eégún"" - In Yoruba, ""eégún"" refers to masquerades or ancestral spirits, and ""ju"" indicates comparison (surpassing). So this part means ""One masquerade surpasses another masquerade.""

2. ""òrìṣá ju òrìṣà"" - ""Òrìṣá"" refers to deities in Yoruba religion, and again we have the comparative ""ju"". This translates to ""One deity surpasses another deity.""

3. ""Pààká lé oníṣàngó wọ̀gbẹ́"" - ""Pààká"" refers to a leopard, ""lé"" means ""chases"" or ""drives"", ""oníṣàngó"" is a devotee of Sango (the deity of thunder), and ""wọ̀gbẹ́"" means ""into the bush/forest"".

Putting it all together, the proverb translates to:

""One masquerade surpasses another; one deity surpasses another; a leopard chases a Sango devotee into the bush.""

The meaning conveys a hierarchy of power and fear - just as some spiritual entities are more powerful than others, even a devotee of a powerful deity like Sango will flee when confronted with a real physical danger like a leopard."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"“Mo yó” ńjẹ́ “mo yó,” “mo kọ̀” ńjẹ́ “mo kọ̀”; jẹun ǹṣó, àgbà ọ̀kánjúwà ni.","“I am full” means “I am full”; “I decline” means “I decline”; eating with abandon, that is the father of all greediness.","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the elements:
- ""Mo yó"" = ""I am full""
- ńjẹ́ = means/signifies
- ""mo kọ̀"" = ""I refuse"" or ""I decline""
- jẹun ǹṣó = ""eating and being watchful"" or ""eating carefully/cautiously""
- àgbà ọ̀kánjúwà = ""an elder with bad character"" or ""an elder with selfish tendencies""
- ni = is

Putting it together, the proverb means:

""'I am full' means 'I am full,' 'I refuse' means 'I refuse'; eating while being watchful is the mark of an elder with bad character.""

The deeper meaning: This proverb criticizes people who say one thing but mean another, particularly elders who should be straightforward. It suggests that someone who eats cautiously while claiming to be full or declining food is displaying poor character. The proverb values honesty and straightforwardness - if you're full, say so clearly; if you're declining, do so clearly. Being deceptive or calculating even in simple matters like eating shows poor character."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Àgbàlagbà kì í wẹwọ́ tán kó ní òun ó jẹ si.,An elder does not wash his hand and then decide to eat more.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step:

1) ""Àgbàlagbà"" means ""an elder"" or ""an old person""
2) ""kì í"" is a negative marker meaning ""does not"" or ""will not""
3) ""wẹwọ́"" refers to ""washing hands""
4) ""tán"" means ""finish"" or ""complete""
5) ""kó ní"" translates to ""and then say"" or ""and then claim""
6) ""òun ó jẹ si"" means ""he/she will eat with dirty hands"" or ""he/she will eat without washing""

Putting it all together, the literal translation would be:
""An elder does not finish washing his hands and then say he will eat with dirty hands.""

The English equivalent that captures the meaning would be:
""An elder doesn't wash his hands thoroughly only to eat with dirty hands.""

The proverb's meaning: This speaks to consistency and following through with proper actions. It suggests that once you've started doing something properly (washing hands), you should complete the process correctly (using those clean hands to eat). It emphasizes that especially for elders who should know better, it makes no sense to begin something properly but then abandon proper practices midway."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ẹni à bá tà ká fowó-o rẹ̀ ra àdá: ó ní ìyà àdá ńjẹ òun.,A person who should be sold for money to purchase a machete bemoans his lack of a machete.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the proverb:
   ""Ẹni à bá tà ká fowó-o rẹ̀ ra àdá: ó ní ìyà àdá ńjẹ òun.""

2) Analyzing the components:
   - ""Ẹni à bá tà"" = ""The person we sell""
   - ""ká fowó-o rẹ̀ ra àdá"" = ""and use their money to buy a cutlass/machete""
   - ""ó ní ìyà àdá ńjẹ òun"" = ""says that the cutlass/machete is making them suffer""

3) Direct translation:
   ""The person whom we sell and use their money to buy a cutlass, says that the cutlass is making them suffer.""

4) Meaning and interpretation:
   This proverb refers to someone who complains about consequences that resulted from their own misfortune or sacrifice. It speaks to situations where a person who has already suffered a loss (being sold) then complains about a secondary consequence (the suffering caused by the cutlass purchased with their money).

English translation:
""One who is sold and whose money is used to buy a cutlass complains that the cutlass is making them suffer."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Kàkà ká dọ̀bálẹ̀ fún Gàm̀bàrí, ká rọ́jú ká kú.","Rather than prostrate oneself in homage or obeisance to a Hausa person, one should rather die.","To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down step by step:

""Kàkà ká dọ̀bálẹ̀ fún Gàm̀bàrí, ká rọ́jú ká kú.""

Breaking down the components:
- ""Kàkà"" means ""rather than"" or ""instead of""
- ""ká dọ̀bálẹ̀"" means ""to prostrate"" or ""to bow down"" (a sign of submission)
- ""fún Gàm̀bàrí"" means ""for the Hausa/northern person"" (Gambari is a term used to refer to Hausa people or northerners)
- ""ká rọ́jú"" means ""to be brave"" or ""to endure""
- ""ká kú"" means ""to die""

Putting it together, the literal translation is:
""Rather than prostrate for the Hausa man, it's better to be brave and die.""

The figurative meaning conveys that it's better to die with dignity than to submit to humiliation or oppression. It expresses the value of maintaining one's honor and self-respect even in the face of death, rather than living in submission."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,À-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa ẹmọ́n; à-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa àfè; à-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa máláàjú.,Feeding-without-leaving kills the Tullberg's rat; feeding-without-departing kills the spotted grass mouse; feeding-without-departing kills the máláàjú rat.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb by breaking it down into parts:

The proverb consists of three parallel phrases with the same structure:
1. ""À-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa ẹmọ́n""
2. ""À-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa àfè""
3. ""À-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa máláàjú""

Breaking down the structure:
- ""À-jẹ-ì-kúrò"" seems to refer to ""refusing to leave"" or ""persistence in staying""
- ""ní ńpa"" means ""is what kills"" or ""is what destroys""
- The last word in each phrase refers to different things:
  * ""ẹmọ́n"" refers to a mosquito
  * ""àfè"" refers to a housefly
  * ""máláàjú"" refers to a housefly with reddish eyes

So the literal translation would be:
""Refusing to leave is what kills the mosquito; refusing to leave is what kills the housefly; refusing to leave is what kills the red-eyed fly.""

The meaning behind this proverb:
This proverb teaches about the danger of overstaying one's welcome or persisting in a situation beyond appropriate time. Just as insects get killed when they linger too long in one place (often getting swatted), people who don't know when to leave or withdraw from situations may face negative consequences.

English translation:
""Knowing when to leave is what saves one from destruction."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"A kì í fi ìka ro etí, ká fi ro imú, ká wá tún fi ta ehín.","One does not use one's finger to clean one's ear passages, use it to pick one's nose, and then use it to pick one's teeth.","Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the proverb: ""A kì í fi ìka ro etí, ká fi ro imú, ká wá tún fi ta ehín.""

2) Word-by-word translation:
- ""A kì í"" = One does not/should not
- ""fi ìka"" = use the finger
- ""ro etí"" = to clean the ear
- ""ká fi"" = and then use it
- ""ro imú"" = to clean the nose
- ""ká wá tún fi"" = and then still use it
- ""ta ehín"" = to pick the teeth

3) Direct translation: ""One should not use the same finger to clean the ear, then clean the nose, and then pick the teeth.""

4) The meaning: This proverb is about hygiene and proper conduct. It warns against using the same tool for multiple tasks that could lead to contamination or improper results.

5) English equivalent meaning: ""Don't use the same tool inappropriately for different sensitive tasks.""

Final translation: ""One should not use the same finger to clean the ear, then the nose, and then pick the teeth."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ṣàkì ńṣe bí ọ̀rá, egungun ńṣe bí ẹran.",The tripe presents itself as fat; the bone presents itself as meat.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down word by word, then put it together for the full meaning.

""Ṣàkì ńṣe bí ọ̀rá, egungun ńṣe bí ẹran.""

Word-by-word analysis:
- ""Ṣàkì"" = sack/bag
- ""ńṣe"" = acts/behaves like
- ""bí"" = like/as
- ""ọ̀rá"" = velvet
- ""egungun"" = bone/skeleton
- ""ńṣe"" = acts/behaves like
- ""bí"" = like/as
- ""ẹran"" = meat/flesh

Putting it together:
""The sack acts like velvet, the bone acts like meat.""

This proverb is about appearances being deceptive. It warns that things aren't always what they seem - a rough sack might appear soft like velvet, and hard bones might appear tender like meat.

The English equivalent might be ""All that glitters is not gold"" or ""Appearances can be deceiving."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ọ̀yájú-u baálé ní ńpàdé ìbòsí lọ́nà.,It is a reckless home owner who is met with alarms when he ventures outside.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down word by word, then construct the full meaning.

Step 1: Identify the key words
- ""Ọ̀yájú"" refers to boldness, impudence, or audacity
- ""baálé"" means ""head of household"" or ""landlord""
- ""ní ńpàdé"" means ""meets"" or ""encounters""
- ""ìbòsí"" refers to insult or disrespect
- ""lọ́nà"" means ""on the way"" or ""on the road""

Step 2: Construct the literal translation
""The impudence/audacity of the landlord meets with insult on the road.""

Step 3: Interpret the meaning
This proverb suggests that when someone in a position of authority (the landlord) acts with excessive boldness or arrogance, they will inevitably encounter disrespect or resistance from others.

Step 4: Provide an equivalent English expression
""The arrogant master will meet disrespect on his path.""

In broader terms, this proverb teaches that pride or arrogance, even from those in power, often leads to humiliation or disrespect. It's similar to the English saying ""Pride comes before a fall."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Àgbàlagbà tí ò kí Ààrẹ ńfi okùn sin ara-a rẹ̀.,An elder who does not greet the Ààrẹ tries a “hanging” rope for size.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb into English by examining each component and finding its meaning.

Breaking down the proverb:
- ""Àgbàlagbà"" = elder/old person
- ""tí ò kí"" = who does not greet/respect
- ""Ààrẹ"" = the king/chief/ruler
- ""ńfi okùn sin ara-a rẹ̀"" = is tying/binding a rope to bury himself

Putting it together in idiomatic English:
""An elder who does not respect the king is preparing for his own funeral.""

The meaning of this proverb is that when someone (especially an elder who should know better) fails to show proper respect to authority, they are essentially inviting trouble or consequences upon themselves. It emphasizes the importance of respecting established leadership and hierarchy in Yoruba culture, suggesting that deliberately failing to do so is a form of self-destruction."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Àì-lápá làdá ò mú; bí a bá lápá, ọmọ owú to-o gégi.",It is a deficiency of biceps that blunts the machete; if one has strong biceps one can cut trees with a cudgel.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the components:
- ""Àì-lápá làdá ò mú"" - The first part seems to say something about lacking strength/arms and a machete not cutting
- ""bí a bá lápá"" - This means ""if one has strength/arms""
- ""ọmọ owú to-o gégi"" - This refers to cotton being able to cut a tree

2) Analyzing key words:
- ""Àì-lápá"" = lack of strength/biceps/arms
- ""làdá ò mú"" = the machete doesn't cut/isn't sharp
- ""bí a bá lápá"" = if one has strength/arms
- ""ọmọ owú"" = cotton (literally ""child of cotton"")
- ""to-o gégi"" = is enough to cut a tree

3) Complete translation:
""It's the lack of strength that makes a machete ineffective; if one has strength, even cotton can cut a tree.""

The meaning: This proverb teaches that determination, willpower, and effort are more important than tools or circumstances. With enough strength and determination, one can accomplish seemingly impossible tasks. Conversely, even the best tools are useless without proper effort and strength behind them."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ibi tí a fi ara sí lara ńgbé.,"Wherever one situates the body, there it inhabits.","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the words:
- ""Ibi"" = place/where
- ""tí"" = that/which
- ""a"" = we
- ""fi ara sí"" = commit oneself to/dedicate oneself to
- ""lara"" = on the body
- ""ńgbé"" = lives/dwells/thrives

Putting it together, the literal translation would be: ""Where we commit ourselves is where the body thrives/lives.""

The meaning in English would be: ""Where we dedicate our efforts is where we prosper.""

This proverb essentially means that we thrive in the places or endeavors to which we devote our energy and attention. It emphasizes the importance of commitment and dedication for success and well-being."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Bí ìlàrí bá fẹ́ tẹ́, a ní kí lọba ó ṣe?","When a courtier seeks disgrace, he asks, “What can the king do?”","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the words:
- ""Bí"" means ""if"" or ""when""
- ""ìlàrí"" refers to the ""palace attendant"" or ""royal servant"" (specifically a high-ranking servant in Yoruba kingdoms)
- ""bá fẹ́"" means ""wants to"" or ""desires to""
- ""tẹ́"" means ""to dethrone"" or ""to bring down""
- ""a ní"" means ""one asks"" or ""people say""
- ""kí"" means ""what""
- ""lọba"" or ""l'ọba"" means ""the king""
- ""ó ṣe"" means ""should do"" or ""can do""

Putting it together, the literal translation is:
""If/when the palace attendant wants to dethrone (the king), one asks what can the king do?""

The English equivalent would be:
""When a royal servant wants to overthrow the king, what can the king do about it?""

This proverb speaks to the vulnerability of leaders to betrayal from those closest to them. It suggests that when someone from within your trusted circle decides to betray you, it can be particularly dangerous and difficult to defend against."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Àfi ohun tí a kì í tà lọ́jà lẹrú kì í jẹ.,The only thing a slave cannot eat is something not available in the market.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down step by step:

""Àfi ohun tí a kì í tà lọ́jà lẹrú kì í jẹ.""

Breaking down the components:
- ""Àfi ohun tí"" = ""Except for the thing that""
- ""a kì í tà"" = ""one does not sell""
- ""lọ́jà"" = ""in the market""
- ""lẹrú kì í jẹ"" = ""a slave does not eat""

Putting it together literally: ""Except for what is not sold in the market, a slave does not eat.""

The meaning in English would be: ""A slave does not eat what cannot be found in the market.""

The deeper meaning of this proverb is about limitations imposed by circumstances. It suggests that people in subordinate positions (symbolized by ""slaves"") can only access or enjoy what is commonly available (represented by ""what is sold in the market""), and have no access to rare, special, or exclusive things.

In contemporary terms, this proverb speaks to how one's social position or resources can limit one's options and experiences."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Àṣá kì í rà kádìẹ gbé kòkòrò dání.,"When a kite hovers, a chicken does not hang on to an insect.","To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step:

1) ""Àṣá"" = hawk
2) ""kì í"" = does not/never
3) ""rà"" = swoop/dive
4) ""kádìẹ"" = for the chicken to
5) ""gbé"" = pick up/catch
6) ""kòkòrò"" = insect
7) ""dání"" = for the owner/for someone else

Putting it all together, the literal translation would be:
""A hawk does not swoop down so that a chicken can catch insects for the owner.""

The meaning of this proverb is:
""A person of higher status or capability doesn't make way for someone of lesser ability to perform a task that benefits others."" 

This proverb speaks to the natural order of things and self-interest - a powerful entity (the hawk) won't sacrifice its advantage just so a less capable entity (the chicken) can benefit someone else. It teaches about the reality of power dynamics and self-interest in society."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ká wí ogún, ká wí ọgbọ̀n, “Ng ò fẹ́, ng ò gbà” laṣiwèré fi ńpẹ̀kun ọ̀ràn.","Whether one speaks twenty times or speaks thirty times, “I do not like it, and I will not accept it” is how the imbecile ends the discussion.","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the components:
- ""Ká wí ogún, ká wí ọgbọ̀n"" - This suggests speaking repeatedly, possibly referencing speaking twenty or thirty times
- ""Ng ò fẹ́, ng ò gbà"" - This means ""I don't want, I don't accept""
- ""laṣiwèré fi ńpẹ̀kun ọ̀ràn"" - This refers to how a foolish person ends or concludes a matter

Putting it together in proper English:

""You may speak twenty times, you may speak thirty times, but 'I don't want it, I won't accept it' is how a fool ends a discussion.""

The meaning: This proverb speaks to stubbornness and closed-mindedness. It suggests that no matter how much wisdom or advice is offered, a foolish person simply refuses to listen or consider other perspectives, abruptly ending discussions with blanket refusals rather than reasoned engagement."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ẹni tí a fẹ́ yàtọ̀ sí ẹni tó ní kò sí irú òun.,A person one loves is different from a person who says there is no one like him/herself.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the proverb:
   - ""Ẹni tí a fẹ́"" = ""The person that we love/like""
   - ""yàtọ̀ sí"" = ""is different from""
   - ""ẹni tó ní"" = ""the person who says""
   - ""kò sí irú òun"" = ""there is no one like him/her""

2) Putting it together literally:
   ""The person that we love is different from the person who says there is no one like him/her.""

3) Understanding the meaning:
   This proverb contrasts someone who is genuinely loved by others with someone who merely boasts about their own uniqueness or importance.

English translation:
""The person who is truly loved is different from the one who claims no one is like them.""

The proverb teaches that true worth is reflected in how others value you, not in self-proclamation of greatness or uniqueness."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Àgùnbánirọ̀ ní ńfojúdini.,It is the person taller than another who shows no respect for the other.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll analyze its components and meaning step by step.

Looking at the Yoruba proverb: ""Àgùnbánirọ̀ ní ńfojúdini.""

Step 1: Breaking down the components:
- ""Àgùnbánirọ̀"" appears to be a compound term possibly referring to a person who does something deceptive or misleading
- ""ní"" is a linking word often meaning ""is"" or ""it is""
- ""ńfojúdini"" can be broken down to something like ""looks at one with"" or ""faces one with""

Step 2: Analyzing the cultural context:
This proverb seems to address deception or hypocrisy, referring to someone who pretends to be something they're not.

Step 3: Determining the meaning:
The proverb appears to describe how a hypocrite or deceiver looks at or treats others.

English translation: ""A hypocrite is the one who looks down on others.""

Alternative translation: ""The deceiver is the one who treats others with contempt.""

The meaning conveys that those who are themselves flawed or deceptive are often the quickest to judge or look down on others."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ìtàkùn tó tó ọ̀pẹ kò tó pé kérin má lọ; ìtàkùn tó pé kérin má lọ Àlọ́, tòun terin ní ńlọ.",A vine as thick as a palm-tree trunk will not stop an elephant; whatever vine attempts to stop an elephant from going to Alọ will go with the elephant instead.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the key words:
- ""Ìtàkùn"" = creeping plant/vine/climber
- ""tó"" = reach/enough
- ""ọ̀pẹ"" = palm tree
- ""kò tó"" = not enough
- ""pé"" = to say
- ""kérin"" = that elephant
- ""má lọ"" = should not go
- ""Àlọ́"" = a place name
- ""tòun terin"" = it and the elephant
- ""ní ńlọ"" = are going

Putting it together:
""The vine that can reach the top of the palm tree is not enough to stop the elephant from going; the vine that says the elephant should not go to Alo, it and the elephant will go together.""

The meaning of this proverb:
This proverb speaks about the futility of a small force trying to restrain something much more powerful. Just as a vine cannot hold back an elephant, regardless of how tall it can climb, when a small entity tries to prevent a much stronger force from taking action, it will either fail or be dragged along with the stronger force.

In English, we might express a similar sentiment with ""You can't hold back the tide"" or ""If you can't beat them, you'll be forced to join them."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Bí a bá ńgúnyán, kòmẹsẹ̀ á yọ.","If one prepares pounded yams, the uninvited should depart.","To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down step by step:

1) ""Bí a bá ńgúnyán"" - This phrase refers to ""if we are pounding/eating pounded yam""
   - ""Bí"" means ""if""
   - ""a"" means ""we""
   - ""bá"" is a conditional marker
   - ""ńgúnyán"" means ""pounding/eating pounded yam"" (yán is pounded yam, a staple food)

2) ""kòmẹsẹ̀ á yọ"" - This indicates ""the knee will show/appear/stick out""
   - ""kòmẹsẹ̀"" refers to ""knee""
   - ""á yọ"" means ""will show/appear/come out""

The literal translation is: ""If we are pounding/eating pounded yam, the knee will show.""

The figurative meaning: This proverb teaches that when engaged in an important task or activity (like eating a staple food), one's true character or hidden aspects will eventually be revealed. It suggests that through continuous interaction or engagement, people's true nature or intentions will eventually become evident.

In English, we might express a similar sentiment with phrases like ""Time reveals all things"" or ""True character emerges through action."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ọmọ àì-jọbẹ̀-rí tí ńja epo sáyà.,A child new to eating stews: he shows himself by dripping palm-oil on his chest.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down step by step.

The proverb is: ""Ọmọ àì-jọbẹ̀-rí tí ńja epo sáyà.""

Breaking it down:
- ""Ọmọ"" means ""child"" or ""person""
- ""àì-jọbẹ̀-rí"" is a compound phrase meaning ""who has never seen/experienced soup"" (àì = not/never, jọ = eat, bẹ̀ = soup, rí = see/experience)
- ""tí"" is a relative pronoun meaning ""who"" or ""that""
- ""ńja"" means ""is rubbing"" or ""is smearing""
- ""epo"" means ""palm oil""
- ""sáyà"" means ""on the chest"" (s' = to, áyà = chest)

Putting it all together, the literal translation is:
""A child who has never seen/eaten soup is rubbing palm oil on their chest.""

The English equivalent meaning would be:
""A person who has never experienced something valuable misuses or wastes resources due to ignorance.""

This proverb speaks to how someone who lacks experience or understanding might misuse resources or fail to appreciate their proper value or application."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Kì í dọwọ́-ọ baba kó ló di ọwọ́ ọmọ.,Responsibility does not devolve on the father only for him to say it is his son's duty.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb into English step by step.

First, let me break down the Yoruba words:
- ""Kì í"" = It does not
- ""dọwọ́-ọ"" = reach the hand of
- ""baba"" = father
- ""kó ló"" = that it becomes
- ""di ọwọ́"" = the hand of
- ""ọmọ"" = child

Putting it together literally: ""It does not reach the father's hand that it becomes the child's hand.""

This is a bit awkward in English, so let me refine the translation to capture the meaning more naturally:

The English translation of ""Kì í dọwọ́-ọ baba kó ló di ọwọ́ ọmọ"" is:
""What belongs in the father's hand does not easily pass to the child's hand.""

The proverb speaks to the idea that authority, responsibility, or possessions that rightfully belong to the elder/parent are not automatically or easily transferred to the child. It suggests respect for hierarchies and the proper time and process for succession or inheritance."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ó yẹ ẹni gbogbo kó dínwó aró, kò yẹ atọ̀ọ́lé.","It is fitting for everybody to bargain to reduce the cost of dyeing clothes, but not the bed wetter.","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb into English step by step.

First, let me break down the components:
- ""Ó yẹ ẹni gbogbo"" = ""It is fitting for everyone"" or ""Everyone should""
- ""kó dínwó aró"" = ""to reduce the money for dye"" or ""to economize on dye""
- ""kò yẹ atọ̀ọ́lé"" = ""it is not fitting for the dyer"" or ""it's not appropriate for the person who dyes cloth""

""Aró"" refers to indigo dye traditionally used in Yoruba textile making, and ""atọ̀ọ́lé"" refers to the professional dyer.

Putting it together, the proverb means:
""Everyone may wish to economize on dye, but this is not appropriate for the dyer.""

The English equivalent meaning would be:
""Everyone may want to cut costs on materials, but the craftsman cannot compromise on the essentials of his trade.""

This proverb teaches that while general consumers may prefer cheaper options, professionals cannot compromise on the quality of their essential materials without undermining their work."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ìbàjẹ́ ọjọ́ kan ò tán bọ̀rọ̀.,The disgrace one incurs in one day does not disappear that soon.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll analyze it word by word and then provide the overall meaning.

Breaking down the proverb ""Ìbàjẹ́ ọjọ́ kan ò tán bọ̀rọ̀"":

- ""Ìbàjẹ́"" = damage, spoilage, or ruin
- ""ọjọ́"" = day
- ""kan"" = one
- ""ò"" = not, doesn't
- ""tán"" = finish, end
- ""bọ̀rọ̀"" = easily, quickly, or lightly

Putting these together literally: ""The damage/ruin of one day doesn't end easily/quickly.""

The English translation would be: ""The consequences of a single day's misfortune don't disappear easily.""

The deeper meaning of this proverb is that a mistake or bad decision made in a short time can have long-lasting consequences. It teaches that we should be careful with our actions because their effects may persist long after the action itself."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ibi tí a ti ńpìtàn ká tó jogún, ká mọ̀ pé ogún ibẹ̀ ò kanni.","Where one must recite genealogies in order to establish one's claim to inheritance, one should know that one really has no claim to patrimony there.","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb by breaking it down step by step.

First, let me identify the key elements:
- ""Ibi tí a ti ńpìtàn"" = ""The place where stories/history are told""
- ""ká tó jogún"" = ""before we inherit/receive inheritance""
- ""ká mọ̀ pé"" = ""we should know that""
- ""ogún ibẹ̀"" = ""the inheritance there""
- ""ò kanni"" = ""does not affect us/concern us""

Putting it together in natural English:
""Before we inherit from a place, we should learn its history to know if that inheritance truly belongs to us.""

The deeper meaning of this proverb suggests that we should understand the full context and history of something before claiming it as our own. It warns against accepting inheritance or benefits without first understanding their origins or implications."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Bí baálẹ̀-ẹ́ bá ńtàkìtì, òrógi là ḿbá ẹmẹsẹ̀.","If the chief is turning somersaults, the messenger should be found standing erect.","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the components:
- ""Bí baálẹ̀-ẹ́ bá ńtàkìtì"" - This first part refers to the landlord/household head (baálẹ̀) doing something characterized as ""tàkìtì"" (staggering or dancing wildly)
- ""òrógi"" - refers to the top of a tree
- ""là ḿbá ẹmẹsẹ̀"" - indicates where one meets or encounters something

The literal translation would be something like: ""If the landlord/household head is dancing wildly/staggering, one meets the tenants/household members at the treetop.""

The meaning of this proverb is: ""When a leader behaves irresponsibly or acts foolishly, his followers will go to extremes or act even more irrationally.""

In English, we might express this sentiment as: ""When the master goes crazy, the servants go wild"" or ""As goes the leader, so go the followers, but often to greater extremes.""

The proverb teaches about the influence of leadership and how people tend to follow their leader's example, sometimes taking it even further."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Afínjú wọ ọjà ó rìn gbẹndẹ́kẹ ọ̀bún wọ ọjà ó rìn ṣùẹ̀ṣùẹ̀; ọ̀bùn ní ó ru ẹrù afínjú relé.,The fashionable person enters the market and walks in a leisurely manner; the filthy person enters the market and walks in a sluggish manner; it is the filthy person that will carry the fashionable person's load to the house for him or her.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me identify the key words and phrases:
- ""Afínjú"" refers to someone who is elegant, stylish, or fashionable
- ""wọ ọjà"" means ""enters the market""
- ""ó rìn gbẹndẹ́kẹ"" describes walking in a proud, swaggering manner
- ""ọ̀bún/ọ̀bùn"" refers to a dirty or filthy person
- ""ó rìn ṣùẹ̀ṣùẹ̀"" describes walking slowly or carefully
- ""ru ẹrù"" means ""carries the load""
- ""relé"" means ""home"" or ""to the house""

The proverb contrasts two people:
1. The elegant person who enters the market walking proudly
2. The dirty/filthy person who enters the market walking carefully/slowly

The twist comes at the end: ""ọ̀bùn ní ó ru ẹrù afínjú relé"" - it is the dirty person who ends up carrying the elegant person's load home.

Complete English translation:
""The elegant person enters the market walking proudly, the dirty person enters the market walking carefully; yet it is the dirty person who carries the elegant person's load home.""

The meaning suggests that appearances can be deceiving, and those who appear humble or lowly often do the real work, while those who show off may not be as productive or helpful as they appear."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Aáyán ati eèràá ṣígun, wọ́n ní àwọ́n ńlọ mú adìẹ àlọ la rí, a ò rábọ̀.","Cockroach and ant make ready for war and say they are off to capture chicken; we see their departure, but not their return.","Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the key words:
- ""Aáyán"" = cockroach
- ""eèràá"" = ant
- ""ṣígun"" = to set out or journey
- ""wọ́n ní"" = they said
- ""àwọ́n ńlọ mú"" = they are going to catch
- ""adìẹ"" = chicken
- ""àlọ la rí"" = we saw them going
- ""a ò rábọ̀"" = we didn't see them returning

2) Constructing the literal translation:
""The cockroach and the ant set out on a journey, they said they were going to catch a chicken. We saw them leaving, but we didn't see them returning.""

3) The meaning of the proverb:
This proverb speaks about taking on tasks that are far beyond one's capabilities. A cockroach and ant are tiny insects that couldn't possibly catch a chicken, so their mission was doomed from the start. The fact that they never returned suggests they failed in their impossible mission.

English translation: ""The cockroach and the ant set out on a journey, claiming they were going to catch a chicken. We saw them leaving, but we never saw them return."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ò mẹ̀yẹ.,A pig does not know what is becoming.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the words:
- ""Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀"" = pig (or pig owner/keeper)
- ""ò"" = negative marker (does not)
- ""mẹ̀yẹ"" = know birds

Putting it together literally: ""A pig does not know birds.""

The meaning of this proverb is: ""A pig does not recognize birds"" or ""The pig is not familiar with birds.""

In terms of its deeper meaning, this proverb suggests that people often lack understanding or appreciation for things outside their own experience or environment. It's used to describe someone who cannot comprehend or value matters beyond their limited knowledge or sphere of existence.

The English equivalent might be something like ""You can't understand what you've never experienced"" or ""One cannot appreciate what lies outside their own world."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ẹ̀wọ̀n tó tó ọ̀pẹ ò tó-ó dá erin dúró; ìtàkùn tó ní kí erin má ròkè ọ̀dàn, tòun terin ní ńlọ.",A chain as thick as a palm-tree cannot stop an elephant; the vine that proposes to stop the elephant from going to the grassland will go with the elephant.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

First, I'll break down the components:
- ""Ẹ̀wọ̀n tó tó ọ̀pẹ ò tó-ó dá erin dúró"" - The first part seems to discuss a rope/chain that can hold a palm tree but cannot stop an elephant
- ""ìtàkùn tó ní kí erin má ròkè ọ̀dàn, tòun terin ní ńlọ"" - The second part talks about a vine that tries to prevent an elephant from climbing a savanna tree, but ends up going along with the elephant

The literal translation:
""A chain that is strong enough to hold a palm tree is not strong enough to stop an elephant; a vine that tells an elephant not to climb the savanna tree ends up going along with the elephant.""

The meaning:
This proverb speaks about knowing your limits and the futility of trying to control something beyond your capacity. It suggests that what works in one situation may be completely inadequate in another that requires greater strength or authority. The second part emphasizes that attempting to restrain something much more powerful than yourself may result in you being carried along by that force instead.

English equivalent proverb: ""Know your limits"" or ""Don't bite off more than you can chew."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Àfòpiná tó ní òun ó pa fìtílà, ara ẹ̀ ni yó pa.",The moth that attempts to kill (put out) the oil lamp will kill itself.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down component by component:

""Àfòpiná"" - This refers to a moth or an insect that flies around fire/light
""tó ní"" - that says/claims
""òun ó pa fìtílà"" - it will put out/extinguish the lamp/light
""ara ẹ̀ ni yó pa"" - it will kill/destroy itself

Putting it all together, the literal translation is:
""The moth that says it will extinguish the lamp will only destroy itself.""

The English equivalent would be:
""The moth that claims it will put out the lamp will only end up killing itself.""

This proverb carries the meaning that when someone tries to destroy something much more powerful than themselves, they are likely to be the one who gets destroyed in the process. It warns against overestimating one's abilities or challenging forces beyond one's capacity."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Àgbàlagbà akàn tó kó sí garawa yègèdè, ojú tì í.",The elderly crab that enters into a bucket; it is thoroughly disgraced.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, I'll break down the key words:
- ""Àgbàlagbà"" means ""elderly person"" or ""elder""
- ""akàn"" refers to a crab
- ""tó kó sí garawa"" means ""who enters/falls into a basket""
- ""yègèdè"" can be translated as ""completely"" or ""totally""
- ""ojú tì í"" means ""becomes ashamed"" or ""feels embarrassed""

Putting it together, the literal translation would be:
""An elderly crab that completely falls into a basket feels embarrassed.""

The meaning of this proverb is about how shameful it is when an elder or experienced person makes a mistake that even beginners should know to avoid. It suggests that those with experience should know better than to fall into obvious traps or make elementary mistakes.

In English, we might express a similar sentiment with phrases like ""You can't teach an old dog new tricks"" or ""An old fox should not be caught in a trap,"" though the Yoruba proverb specifically emphasizes the shame or embarrassment that comes with such a mistake."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,A pè ọ́ lọ́mọ erín-màgbọn ò ńyọ̀; ìwọ pàápàá ló mì í?,"You are described as the child of the elephant that swallows coconuts, and you rejoice; are you the one who swallows coconuts?","Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

First, let's break down the components:
- ""A pè ọ́ lọ́mọ erín-màgbọn"" = ""You are called a child of the elephant with thirty tusks""
- ""ò ńyọ̀"" = ""you don't rejoice/aren't happy""
- ""ìwọ pàápàá ló mì í?"" = ""are you the one carrying it?"" or ""are you the one bearing the weight?""

Putting it together, the proverb means:

""You are called the child of an elephant with thirty tusks, and you don't rejoice; are you the one carrying the weight?""

The meaning behind this proverb is about perspective on honor versus burden. It suggests that when you receive an impressive title or association, you should appreciate the honor without worrying about the responsibilities that don't fall on you. Essentially, it's saying ""enjoy the prestige that comes with an association without worrying about burdens you don't actually have to bear."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Olówó ní ḿbá ọlọ́rọ̀-ọ́ rìn; ẹgbẹ́ ní ḿbá ẹgbẹ́ ṣeré.,It is a rich person that keeps company with a wealthy person; only people of equal standing play together.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb into English by analyzing it step by step.

First, let me break down the proverb:
""Olówó ní ḿbá ọlọ́rọ̀-ọ́ rìn; ẹgbẹ́ ní ḿbá ẹgbẹ́ ṣeré.""

Breaking down the components:
- ""Olówó"" means ""a wealthy person"" or ""a person with money""
- ""ní ḿbá"" means ""is the one who walks with"" or ""associates with""
- ""ọlọ́rọ̀"" means ""a rich person""
- ""rìn"" means ""to walk"" or ""to associate with""
- ""ẹgbẹ́"" means ""peer"" or ""equal""
- ""ṣeré"" means ""to play"" or ""to have fun with""

The first part ""Olówó ní ḿbá ọlọ́rọ̀-ọ́ rìn"" translates to ""The wealthy person associates with the rich person.""

The second part ""ẹgbẹ́ ní ḿbá ẹgbẹ́ ṣeré"" translates to ""Peers play with peers"" or ""Equals have fun with equals.""

Complete translation:
""The wealthy associate with the rich; peers play with their equals.""

This proverb emphasizes that people tend to associate with those of similar social or economic status. It reflects the social tendency for people to form relationships and friendships with those who share similar backgrounds or circumstances."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Kí ẹrú mọ ara ẹ̀ lẹ́rú; kí ìwọ̀fà mọ ara ẹ̀ níwọ̀fà; kí ọmọlúwàbí mọ ara ẹ̀ lẹ́rú Ọlọ́run ọba.,Let the slave know him/herself as a slave; let the pawn know him/herself as a pawn; let the well born person know him/herself as the child of God.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the first part: ""Kí ẹrú mọ ara ẹ̀ lẹ́rú""
   - ""Kí"" means ""let"" or ""may""
   - ""ẹrú"" refers to a ""slave"" in traditional Yoruba context
   - ""mọ ara ẹ̀"" means ""know themselves/itself""
   - ""lẹ́rú"" means ""as a slave""
   - So this part means: ""Let the slave know themselves as a slave""

2) The second part: ""kí ìwọ̀fà mọ ara ẹ̀ níwọ̀fà""
   - ""ìwọ̀fà"" refers to a ""pawn"" or ""indentured servant"" in Yoruba tradition
   - Similar structure: ""Let the pawn know themselves as a pawn""

3) The third part: ""kí ọmọlúwàbí mọ ara ẹ̀ lẹ́rú Ọlọ́run ọba""
   - ""ọmọlúwàbí"" refers to a well-bred, cultured person with good character
   - ""lẹ́rú Ọlọ́run ọba"" means ""as a servant of God the king""
   - So this means: ""Let the person of good character know themselves as a servant of God the king""

Complete translation:
""Let the slave know themselves as a slave; let the pawn know themselves as a pawn; let the person of good character know themselves as a servant of God the king.""

The proverb speaks to knowing one's place or position in society and the natural order, with the underlying message that even the most virtuous person should maintain humility as a servant of God."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,A kì í gbọ́n ju ẹni tí a máa dÍfá fún.,One cannot be wiser than the person for whom one will consult the Ifá oracle.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the words:
- ""A kì í"" = One does not/should not
- ""gbọ́n ju"" = be wiser than
- ""ẹni tí"" = the person whom
- ""a máa dÍfá fún"" = one consults Ifa for (or one divines for)

Ifá refers to the Yoruba divination system where a priest/diviner (babalawo) interprets the will of the deities for someone seeking guidance.

Putting it together, the literal translation is:
""One should not be wiser than the person for whom one is consulting Ifá.""

The English equivalent meaning would be:
""One should not claim to know more than the person one is advising"" or ""An advisor shouldn't pretend to know more about someone's situation than they do themselves.""

This proverb cautions against arrogance when giving advice and reminds us to respect that people understand their own circumstances, even when seeking guidance."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Kí ni wọ́n ti ńṣe Àmọ́dù nÍlọrin? Ewúrẹ́ ńjẹ́ bẹ́ẹ̀.,What use do the people of Ilorin have for Ahmadu? Even goats are so named.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the proverb:
""Kí ni wọ́n ti ńṣe Àmọ́dù nÍlọrin?"" = ""What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin?""
""Ewúrẹ́ ńjẹ́ bẹ́ẹ̀."" = ""The goat is eating like that.""

The proverb refers to someone named Àmọ́dù in the city of Ilorin, and then makes a seemingly disconnected statement about a goat eating.

This appears to be a traditional Yoruba proverb about unconcern or indifference. The connection between the two parts creates the meaning: while something is happening to Amodu in Ilorin, the goat just continues eating, unbothered.

The English translation would be:
""What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat just keeps eating.""

The implied meaning is: ""Why should I be concerned about what's happening elsewhere (or to others) when it doesn't affect me?"" It criticizes indifference to the suffering or problems of others."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,A-dá-má-lè-ṣe àdàbà tí ńdún bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀.,Start-something-it-cannot-finish dove that makes bombastic noises.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

First, I'll analyze the components:
- ""A-dá-má-lè-ṣe"" appears to be a name or phrase meaning ""one who cannot do"" or ""one who is incapable""
- ""àdàbà"" means ""dove"" or ""pigeon""
- ""tí ńdún bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀"" refers to the sound the dove makes - ""bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀"" is onomatopoeic for the cooing sound

Putting it together, the literal translation would be something like:
""The one-who-cannot-do is like the dove that coos bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀.""

The figurative meaning appears to be:
""A person who claims inability is like a dove that still manages to coo.""

This proverb essentially means that someone who claims they cannot do something but still manages to complain or make noise about it is being hypocritical. It points out the contradiction of someone claiming incapability while still demonstrating some form of ability (like complaining).

English equivalent: ""Actions speak louder than words"" or ""If you have enough energy to complain, you have enough energy to act."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,A-lu-dùndún kì í dárin.,The dùndún player does not lead a song.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step:

1) Let me analyze the components of the proverb:
   - ""A-lu-dùndún"" refers to someone who plays or beats the dùndún (a type of talking drum in Yoruba culture)
   - ""kì í"" is a negative marker meaning ""does not"" or ""cannot""
   - ""dárin"" means ""to compose a song"" or ""to start/initiate music""

2) The literal translation would be: ""The dundun drummer does not compose the song.""

3) Understanding the cultural context: In Yoruba musical tradition, the drummer (especially of the talking drum) is typically responsible for following the lead of the singer or responding to the melody, not creating the original composition.

4) The meaning of the proverb: This proverb expresses that everyone has their role in a process. The person who implements or executes something is not necessarily the one who should conceive or initiate it.

English translation: ""The drummer of the dundun does not compose the song.""

Cultural equivalent meaning: ""The executor is not the originator"" or ""The implementer is not the creator."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Aláṣọ-kan kì í ná ànárẹ.,A person who has only one set of clothing does not bargain until he is wet.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down step by step:

1) ""Aláṣọ-kan"" - This refers to ""a person with only one cloth/garment"" (alá = owner of, aṣọ = cloth/garment, kan = one)

2) ""kì í"" - This is a negative marker meaning ""does not"" or ""never""

3) ""ná"" - This verb means ""to spend"" or ""to use lavishly""

4) ""ànárẹ̀"" - This refers to ""bleach"" or ""a bleaching agent"" used to whiten clothes

Putting it all together, the literal translation is:
""A person with only one cloth/garment never uses bleach on it.""

The English meaning/equivalent would be:
""A person with only one garment cannot afford to bleach it.""

The deeper meaning of this proverb is about resource management - when you have limited resources, you can't afford to take risks with them or use them carelessly. It teaches prudence and careful management of what little one has."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ọjọ́ àgbà-á kú sàn ju ọjọ́ àgbà-á tẹ́.,The day an elder dies is far better than the day an elder is disgraced.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll analyze it word by word and then provide the overall meaning.

Breaking it down:
- ""Ọjọ́"" - day/time
- ""àgbà"" - elder/old person
- ""-á"" - a suffix used for emphasis
- ""kú"" - to die
- ""sàn"" - to be better
- ""ju"" - more than
- ""ọjọ́"" - day/time
- ""àgbà"" - elder/old person
- ""-á"" - emphasis suffix
- ""tẹ́"" - to be disgraced or humiliated

Putting it together:
""Ọjọ́ àgbà-á kú sàn ju ọjọ́ àgbà-á tẹ́.""

English translation: ""The day an elder dies is better than the day an elder is disgraced.""

This proverb reflects the Yoruba cultural value placed on dignity, honor, and respect for elders. It suggests that maintaining one's honor and dignity until death is preferable to living with shame or disgrace. It emphasizes that reputation and honor are sometimes more valuable than life itself."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ẹyẹ ò lè rí omi inú àgbọn bù mu.,A bird cannot get at the liquid inside a coconut to drink.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the components:
   - ""Ẹyẹ"" means ""bird""
   - ""ò lè"" means ""cannot""
   - ""rí"" means ""see"" or ""find""
   - ""omi inú àgbọn"" means ""water inside a coconut""
   - ""bù mu"" means ""to scoop and drink""

2) Putting it together literally:
   ""A bird cannot see/find the water inside a coconut to drink.""

3) Understanding the meaning:
   This proverb speaks to the inaccessibility of something valuable. The water inside a coconut is refreshing and nutritious, but a bird cannot access it because the coconut shell is hard and closed.

4) English translation:
   ""A bird cannot drink the water inside a coconut.""

This proverb metaphorically conveys that some resources or opportunities, though they exist, may be inaccessible to certain individuals due to natural limitations or barriers."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,“Mo mọ̀-ọ́ tán” lOrò-ó fi ńgbé ọkùnrin.,“I know it all” is the reason for Orò's carrying a man away.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the components:
- ""Mo mọ̀-ọ́ tán"" = ""I know it completely"" or ""I have figured it out""
- ""lOrò-ó fi"" = ""is how/why Oro"" (Oro being a Yoruba deity or spiritual entity)
- ""ńgbé ọkùnrin"" = ""carries away men"" or ""takes men""

Putting it together, the literal translation would be:
""'I know it completely' is how/why Oro carries away men.""

The meaning behind this proverb:
This proverb is warning against overconfidence or the danger of thinking you know everything. It suggests that when someone becomes too confident in their knowledge (""I know it completely""), that's when they become vulnerable to being ""carried away"" by Oro (representing danger or death).

The English equivalent would be:
""'I have it all figured out' is how Oro carries away men.""

The general message is that excessive confidence or presumption of complete knowledge often leads to downfall."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Nígbàtí à ńto ọkà a ò to ti ẹmọ́ si.,When we were stacking the corn we did not stack some for the brown rat.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down into components and analyze it step by step.

""Nígbàtí"" means ""when"" or ""while""
""à ńto"" means ""we are arranging"" or ""we are setting up""
""ọkà"" refers to ""corn"" or ""maize""
""a ò to"" means ""we do not arrange"" or ""we do not set up""
""ti ẹmọ́ si"" means ""that of palm wine"" (ẹmọ́ refers to palm wine)

Putting it all together, the literal translation is:
""When we are arranging corn, we do not arrange palm wine.""

The English equivalent or meaning would be:
""When we are dealing with one matter, we don't address a completely different matter at the same time.""

This proverb teaches about focus, prioritization, and handling one task at a time. It advises against trying to handle multiple unrelated matters simultaneously, suggesting that proper attention should be given to each distinct task in its own time."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Àbúrò rẹ ńdáṣọ fún ọ, o ní o ò lo elékuru; ta ní ńlo alákàrà?","Your junior brother (or sister) buys clothing for you, and you say you will not wear anything with bean-grits patterns; who has the right to opt for clothing with a bean-fritter patterns?","Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

First, let me break down each part of the proverb:
- ""Àbúrò rẹ"" = Your younger sibling/brother/sister
- ""ńdáṣọ fún ọ"" = is sewing clothes for you
- ""o ní o ò lo elékuru"" = you say you don't wear clothes made of ekuru (a type of bean cake) seller's cloth
- ""ta ní ńlo alákàrà?"" = who wears cloth from an akara (bean fritter) seller?

Putting it together, the literal translation is:
""Your younger sibling is sewing clothes for you, you say you don't wear clothes from an ekuru seller; who wears clothes from an akara seller?""

The meaning in English would be:
""Your younger sibling offers to make clothes for you, but you reject them claiming they're not good enough (like an ekuru seller's cloth); yet who actually wears even lower quality clothes (like those from an akara seller)?""

This proverb criticizes being ungrateful or rejecting help while being in no position to be picky. It warns against looking down on assistance from family members when you have no better alternative."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Bí kò sí tọ̀bùn èèyàn, ta ni ìbá jí lówùúrọ̀ tí kò bọ́jú ṣáṣá?","But for a person of filthy habits, who would wake in the morning and not wash his or her face clean?","Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the proverb: ""Bí kò sí tọ̀bùn èèyàn, ta ni ìbá jí lówùúrọ̀ tí kò bọ́jú ṣáṣá?""

2) Key terms:
- ""Bí kò sí"" means ""if there is no""
- ""tọ̀bùn"" refers to ""personal benefit/gain""
- ""èèyàn"" means ""person/human""
- ""ta ni ìbá"" means ""who would""
- ""jí lówùúrọ̀"" means ""wake up in the morning""
- ""tí kò bọ́jú ṣáṣá"" means ""and not wash their face""

3) Literal translation: ""If there is no personal benefit, who would wake up in the morning and not wash their face?""

4) Meaning in context: This proverb suggests that people are motivated by self-interest. Just as everyone naturally washes their face in the morning (a basic self-care activity), people naturally act in ways that benefit themselves.

English translation: ""If there were no personal benefit, who would wake up in the morning and not wash their face?""

The equivalent meaning in English might be: ""Everyone acts in their own self-interest."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Àpọ́nlé ni “İyá-a Káà”; ìyá kan ò sí ní káà tí kò lórúkọ.,Calling a person “Mother of the Compound” is only a mark of respect; there is no mother in the compound who does not have a name.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the components:
- ""Àpọ́nlé ni ""İyá-a Káà"""" - This first part refers to ""İyá-a Káà"" (Mother of Reading/Education) as an honor or respect
- ""ìyá kan ò sí ní káà tí kò lórúkọ"" - This part is saying ""there is no mother in education/reading who doesn't have a name""

The term ""Káà"" seems to relate to reading or education, and ""İyá-a Káà"" would be like ""Mother of Education"" or a female teacher.

""Àpọ́nlé"" refers to honor, respect, or reverence.

""ò sí"" means ""doesn't exist"" or ""there isn't""

""lórúkọ"" means ""has a name"" or ""possesses a name""

Putting it all together, the English translation would be:

""'Mother of Education' is a title of honor; there is no mother in education who doesn't have a name/reputation.""

The deeper meaning is that teachers or those who impart knowledge deserve respect and recognition, and their contributions always leave a lasting legacy or reputation."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Bí iná bá dun ọbẹ̀, a dá ọ̀rọ̀ sọ.","If the fire gets at the stew, the stew will burst into speech.","To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step:

1) ""Bí iná bá dun ọbẹ̀"" - This part refers to ""if fire/heat makes the soup hot"" or ""when the fire heats up the soup""
   - ""Bí"" means ""if"" or ""when""
   - ""iná"" means ""fire"" or ""heat""
   - ""bá dun ọbẹ̀"" refers to making the soup hot/spicy

2) ""a dá ọ̀rọ̀ sọ"" - This part means ""it creates a conversation"" or ""it causes talk""
   - ""a dá"" means ""it creates"" or ""it causes""
   - ""ọ̀rọ̀ sọ"" means ""to talk"" or ""conversation""

Putting these parts together, the literal translation would be: ""When the fire makes the soup hot, it creates conversation.""

The figurative meaning of this proverb is: ""Controversial or sensitive matters tend to generate discussion."" It suggests that just as spicy food gets people's attention and reaction, provocative situations or issues naturally stimulate conversation and debate.

In English, we might express a similar sentiment with phrases like ""That's food for thought"" or ""That's something to talk about."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Àṣejù baba àṣetẹ́; ẹ̀tẹ́ ní ńgbẹ̀hìn àṣejù; àgbàlagbà tó wẹ̀wù àṣejù ẹ̀tẹ́ ni yó fi rí.,Lack of moderation is the father of disgrace; disgrace comes of immoderation; a grown person who clothes himself in immoderation will find disgrace.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down piece by piece:

""Àṣejù baba àṣetẹ́"" - This first part establishes a relationship between ""àṣejù"" (excess/extravagance) and ""àṣetẹ́"" (disgrace/shame). ""Baba"" means ""father"" but is used here to mean that one causes or leads to the other.

""ẹ̀tẹ́ ní ńgbẹ̀hìn àṣejù"" - This part states that ""ẹ̀tẹ́"" (shame/disgrace) follows ""àṣejù"" (excess).

""àgbàlagbà tó wẹ̀wù àṣejù ẹ̀tẹ́ ni yó fi rí"" - This final part talks about an elder (""àgbàlagbà"") who dresses (""wẹ̀wù"") in excess/extravagance will end up in disgrace/shame.

Putting it all together, the English translation would be:

""Excess is the father of disgrace; disgrace follows excess; an elder who dresses extravagantly will end in disgrace.""

The meaning conveys that excessive behavior leads to shame or disgrace, particularly warning that elders (who should know better) who indulge in extravagance will face humiliation."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ọjọ́ kan ṣoṣo là ńtẹ́; ojoojúmọ́ lojú ńtini.,It takes one day only for one to disgrace oneself; the shame is a daily affair.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll analyze each part:

""Ọjọ́ kan ṣoṣo là ńtẹ́"" - This first part refers to ""one day"" (Ọjọ́ kan) and contains a reference to stepping or treading (tẹ́).

""ojoojúmọ́ lojú ńtini"" - This second part refers to ""everyday"" (ojoojúmọ́) and contains a reference to the eye (ojú) and something affecting or bothering one.

Putting these meanings together in context:

""Ọjọ́ kan ṣoṣo là ńtẹ́; ojoojúmọ́ lojú ńtini.""
Translation: ""We step on the ground only once in a while, but we use our eyes every day.""

The deeper meaning of this proverb is about resource management and priorities. It suggests that while some resources are used sparingly (like stepping on a particular spot), others are in constant use (like our eyes/sight). This teaches that we should value and take special care of things we depend on daily."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,A kì í dákẹ́ ká ṣìwí; a kì í wò sùn-ùn ká dáràn.,One does not keep quiet and yet misspeak; one does not silently contemplate the world and yet get into trouble.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb into English step by step.

First, let me break down the proverb into its two parts:
1. ""A kì í dákẹ́ ká ṣìwí""
2. ""A kì í wò sùn-ùn ká dáràn""

Breaking down the first part:
- ""A kì í"" means ""One should not"" or ""We do not""
- ""dákẹ́"" means ""keep quiet"" or ""remain silent""
- ""ká"" means ""and then"" or ""and yet""
- ""ṣìwí"" means ""speak wrongly"" or ""misspeak""

So the first part means: ""One should not remain silent and yet be accused of speaking wrongly""

Breaking down the second part:
- ""A kì í"" again means ""One should not"" or ""We do not""
- ""wò sùn-ùn"" means ""look on"" or ""be a mere spectator""
- ""ká"" means ""and then"" or ""and yet""
- ""dáràn"" means ""be guilty"" or ""be found guilty of an offense""

So the second part means: ""One should not be a mere spectator and yet be found guilty""

Putting it together in English:
""One should not be silent and be accused of speaking wrongly; one should not be a mere onlooker and be found guilty.""

The essence of this proverb is about the importance of speaking up and taking action when necessary, as silence or inaction doesn't protect one from blame or accusation."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ṣe bóo ti mọ, ẹlẹ́wàa Ṣàpọ́n.","Moderate your preening and strutting, beautiful woman of Ṣàpọ́n.","To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll analyze it step by step:

1) Let me break down the proverb: ""Ṣe bóo ti mọ, ẹlẹ́wàa Ṣàpọ́n.""

2) Breaking down the components:
   - ""Ṣe bóo ti mọ"" - This phrase means something like ""Do as you know"" or ""Act according to your knowledge""
   - ""ẹlẹ́wàa"" - This refers to someone with beauty or someone beautiful
   - ""Ṣàpọ́n"" - This appears to be a proper name or place

3) Putting the meaning together:
   The proverb essentially means ""Do as you know how to do, beautiful one of Ṣàpọ́n"" or ""Act according to your knowledge, beauty of Ṣàpọ́n.""

4) The underlying meaning:
   This proverb appears to be advising someone to act according to their knowledge or abilities. It suggests that one should perform within their capabilities rather than pretending to know more than they do.

The English translation would be: ""Act according to your knowledge, beauty of Ṣàpọ́n.""

This proverb likely encourages authenticity and honesty about one's abilities rather than pretense."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Gbogbo èèyàn ní ńsunkún-un Bánjọ; ṣùgbọ́n Bánjọ ò sunkún ara ẹ̀.,"Everybody laments Banjọ's fate, but Banjọ does not lament his own fate.","To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down into components and then provide the full English translation.

Step 1: Breaking down the proverb:
- ""Gbogbo èèyàn"" = ""All people"" or ""Everyone""
- ""ní ńsunkún-un Bánjọ"" = ""are crying for/mourning Banjo""
- ""ṣùgbọ́n"" = ""but""
- ""Bánjọ"" = a person's name
- ""ò sunkún ara ẹ̀"" = ""does not cry for himself"" or ""does not mourn himself""

Step 2: Putting it together:
""Everyone is crying for Banjo, but Banjo does not cry for himself.""

This proverb conveys the idea that sometimes others worry about or pity someone who isn't concerned about their own situation. It can be used to express that outsiders might be more troubled about a person's circumstances than the person actually experiencing them."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Idà ahun la fi ńpa ahun.,It is with its own sword that one kills the tortoise.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll analyze it step by step:

1) Breaking down the components:
   - ""Idà"" means ""sword"" or ""cutlass"" in Yoruba
   - ""ahun"" refers to a ""tortoise""
   - ""la fi"" means ""is what is used to""
   - ""ńpa"" means ""to kill""
   - ""ahun"" again refers to ""tortoise""

2) Putting it together literally:
   ""The tortoise's sword/cutlass is what is used to kill the tortoise""

3) Understanding the meaning:
   This proverb suggests that someone's own weapon, creation, or words can be turned against them. It's similar to the English expressions ""hoist by one's own petard"" or ""falling on one's own sword.""

4) Polished translation:
   ""The tortoise is killed by its own sword.""

The meaning conveys that a person's downfall often comes from their own actions, words, or creations."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Oúnjẹ ọmọ kékeré a máa wọ àgbà nínú; òrùka ọmọ kékeré ni kì í wọ ágbá lọ́wọ́.,A youth's food can enter the stomach of an elder; it is only a youth's ring that cannot slip unto an elder's finger.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb by breaking it down step by step.

First, let's separate the two parts of the proverb:

1) ""Oúnjẹ ọmọ kékeré a máa wọ àgbà nínú""
2) ""òrùka ọmọ kékeré ni kì í wọ ágbá lọ́wọ́""

Breaking down the first part:
- ""Oúnjẹ"" means ""food""
- ""ọmọ kékeré"" means ""small child"" or ""young child""
- ""a máa wọ"" means ""can/will fit into""
- ""àgbà nínú"" means ""elder's stomach"" or ""adult's belly""

So the first part translates to: ""A small child's food can fit into an elder's stomach""

Breaking down the second part:
- ""òrùka"" means ""ring""
- ""ọmọ kékeré"" means ""small child"" or ""young child""
- ""ni kì í wọ ágbá lọ́wọ́"" means ""cannot fit on an elder's finger/hand""

So the second part translates to: ""A small child's ring cannot fit on an elder's finger""

The complete translation:
""A small child's food can fit into an elder's stomach, but a small child's ring cannot fit on an elder's finger.""

This proverb contrasts what can and cannot be shared between generations, highlighting that while some things (like food) can be enjoyed by both young and old, other things (like items sized for children) cannot be used by adults."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,“Ẹ fà á wọlé” ló yẹ ẹlẹ́ṣin.,“Lead it into the stable” is what becomes a horseman.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step:

1) ""Ẹ fà á wọlé"" - This phrase means ""Pull it inside"" or ""Draw it in""
2) ""ló yẹ"" - means ""is appropriate for"" or ""is befitting for""
3) ""ẹlẹ́ṣin"" - refers to ""the owner of a horse"" or ""horseman""

Putting these elements together:

The literal translation would be: ""Pull it inside"" is appropriate for the horseman.

The meaning of this proverb is that a horseman should bring his horse inside (or to shelter) - suggesting that people should take proper care of their valuable possessions or responsibilities. It emphasizes the importance of protecting what is valuable to you.

In English, the proverb could be expressed as: ""The horseman ought to bring his horse inside"" or ""A horseman should shelter his horse.""

The cultural implication is about responsibility and proper care of one's assets or dependents."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ajá kì í lọ ságinjù lọ ṣọdẹ ẹkùn.,A dog does not go into the wild to hunt a leopard.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down word by word, then combine the meaning.

""Ajá"" = dog
""kì í"" = does not/never
""lọ"" = go
""ságinjù"" = to the wilderness/forest (sá + iginjù)
""lọ"" = to go (repeated for emphasis)
""ṣọdẹ"" = to hunt (ṣe + ọdẹ = to do hunting)
""ẹkùn"" = tiger/leopard

Putting it together literally: ""A dog does not go to the wilderness to hunt a tiger/leopard.""

The English translation is: ""A dog does not go into the wilderness to hunt a tiger.""

The meaning of this proverb: It cautions against taking on challenges that are far beyond one's capabilities or attempting something that would likely lead to one's destruction. It advises knowing your limitations and not foolishly putting yourself in dangerous situations against much more powerful opponents."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Alátiṣe ní ḿmọ àtiṣe ara-a rẹ̀.,The person who must settle his/her affair knows best how he/she plans to go about doing so.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down into components and analyze it step by step.

1) ""Alátiṣe"" - This appears to be a compound term:
   - ""Alá"" suggests ""one who has"" or ""one who does""
   - ""tiṣe"" relates to ""doing"" or ""making""

2) ""ní ḿmọ"" - This means ""knows"" or ""is aware of""

3) ""àtiṣe"" - This refers to ""mistake,"" ""fault,"" or ""wrongdoing""

4) ""ara-a rẹ̀"" - This means ""himself/herself"" or ""one's own self""

Putting it all together, the literal translation would be something like:
""One who has made mistakes knows their own mistakes.""

The English equivalent proverb would be:
""The one who has erred knows their own faults.""

This proverb suggests that people are often aware of their own shortcomings or mistakes, even if they don't acknowledge them publicly. It can also imply that experience with making mistakes gives one insight into recognizing those same mistakes."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Àpárá ńlá, ìjà ní ńdà.",Excessive ribbing unfailingly leads to a fight.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step:

1) Let me identify the components of the proverb:
   - ""Àpárá ńlá"" - This refers to a big/great thunder or lightning
   - ""ìjà"" - means ""fight"" or ""quarrel""
   - ""ní ńdà"" - means ""is what it causes"" or ""is what it brings""

2) Putting these components together:
   ""Àpárá ńlá, ìjà ní ńdà"" literally means ""Great thunder/lightning brings about fights/quarrels""

3) Understanding the cultural context:
   In Yoruba culture, thunder and lightning are often associated with power, disturbance, and sudden dramatic events.

4) The English translation would be:
   ""Great thunder only brings about quarrels.""

The proverb suggests that excessive or dramatic displays (like loud thunder) tend to create conflict rather than resolve situations. It warns against unnecessary drama or loudness that might escalate tensions rather than solve problems."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Òní, ẹtú jìnfìn, ọ̀la, ẹtú jìnfìn; ẹtu nìkan lẹran tó wà nígbó?","Today, the antelope falls into the ditch; tomorrow, the antelope falls into the ditch; is the antelope the only animal in the forest?","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the key words:
- ""Òní"" means ""today""
- ""ẹtú"" refers to a duiker (a small antelope)
- ""jìnfìn"" means ""to eat soup"" or ""to have as meat in soup""
- ""ọ̀la"" means ""tomorrow""
- ""ẹran"" means ""meat"" or ""animal""
- ""nígbó"" means ""in the forest""

The literal translation would be:
""Today, duiker meat for soup; tomorrow, duiker meat for soup; is duiker the only animal in the forest?""

The meaning of this proverb:
This proverb criticizes monotony or lack of variety. It questions why someone would keep eating or using the same thing repeatedly when there are many other options available. It encourages people to explore alternatives and variety rather than sticking to just one familiar option.

In English, we might express a similar sentiment with phrases like ""variety is the spice of life"" or ""why not try something new?"""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ìyàwó tó na ọmọ ọbàkan, ọ̀rọ̀ ló fẹ́ gbọ́.",The wife who whips a relative of her husband is asking for stern rebuke.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down into its components:

""Ìyàwó"" = wife
""tó"" = who
""na"" = beats/disciplines
""ọmọ ọbàkan"" = stepchild (literally ""child of another mother"")
""ọ̀rọ̀"" = word/talk/trouble
""ló"" = is what (contraction of ""ni ó"")
""fẹ́"" = wants
""gbọ́"" = to hear

Putting it together step by step:
""Ìyàwó tó na ọmọ ọbàkan"" = ""A wife who beats/disciplines a stepchild""
""ọ̀rọ̀ ló fẹ́ gbọ́"" = ""is looking for trouble"" (literally ""wants to hear words"")

Complete translation: ""A wife who disciplines a stepchild is looking for trouble.""

The proverb warns about the sensitive dynamics in blended families, suggesting that when a stepmother disciplines her stepchild, it often leads to family conflict or tension."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,“Ọjọ́ tí mo ti ḿbọ̀ ng ò rírú ẹ̀ rí”: olúwa ẹ̀-ẹ́ mọ ìwọ̀n ara ẹ̀ ni.,“In all the days I have walked this earth I have never seen the like”: that person knows his place.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

First, let me break down the components:
- ""Ọjọ́ tí mo ti ḿbọ̀ ng ò rírú ẹ̀ rí"" - This is a quote/statement
- ""olúwa ẹ̀-ẹ́ mọ ìwọ̀n ara ẹ̀ ni"" - This is the explanatory part of the proverb

For the first part:
""Ọjọ́ tí mo ti ḿbọ̀"" = ""Since the day I was born"" or ""All my life""
""ng ò rírú ẹ̀ rí"" = ""I have never seen the likes of it""

For the second part:
""olúwa ẹ̀-ẹ́ mọ ìwọ̀n ara ẹ̀ ni"" = ""its owner knows its own worth/value"" or ""the owner knows its measure""

Putting it together, the proverb translates to:

""'I've never seen anything like this in my life': only the owner knows its true worth.""

The meaning conveys that only those who possess or own something truly understand its value or significance, even when others express surprise or amazement about it."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Àì-kúkú-joye, ó sàn ju, “Ẹnuù mi ò ká ìlú” lọ.","Not-assuming-the-position-of-ruler-at-all is far better than, “My word is not heeded by the people.”","To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down component by component:

""Àì-kúkú-joye"" - This means ""not having been installed as a king/chief"" or ""not ruling at all""
""ó sàn ju"" - This means ""it is better than""
""Ẹnuù mi ò ká ìlú"" - This translates to ""my mouth/reign is not sufficient for the town"" or ""I couldn't handle the responsibilities of ruling the town""
""lọ"" - This is a comparative marker, completing the ""better than"" structure

Putting it together, the proverb means:

""It is better not to become a king at all than to admit that one couldn't handle the responsibilities of ruling.""

The deeper meaning is that it's more honorable to avoid taking on a position of leadership than to take it and then fail or admit inadequacy. It speaks to the importance of knowing one's capabilities before accepting responsibilities, especially those involving leadership over others."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,À-wín-ná-wó ò yẹni; à-gbà-bọ̀-ọ ṣòkòtò ò yẹ ọmọ èèyàn; bí kò fúnni lẹ́sẹ̀ a dòrògí; ohun ẹni ní ńyẹni.,Borrowing-money-to-spend does not speak well of one; borrowed trousers do not become a person; if it is not tight around the legs it is difficult to remove; it is one's thing that fits one.,"# Translating Yoruba Proverb to English

Let me break down this Yoruba proverb step by step:

""À-wín-ná-wó ò yẹni; à-gbà-bọ̀-ọ ṣòkòtò ò yẹ ọmọ èèyàn; bí kò fúnni lẹ́sẹ̀ a dòrògí; ohun ẹni ní ńyẹni.""

Breaking it into parts:
1. ""À-wín-ná-wó ò yẹni"" - Squandering money doesn't befit a person
2. ""à-gbà-bọ̀-ọ ṣòkòtò ò yẹ ọmọ èèyàn"" - Taking off someone's trousers (disrespecting them) doesn't befit a human being
3. ""bí kò fúnni lẹ́sẹ̀ a dòrògí"" - If it doesn't give you legs, it will make you stumble
4. ""ohun ẹni ní ńyẹni"" - What belongs to you is what befits you

Complete English translation:
""Squandering money doesn't befit a person; disrespecting others doesn't befit a human being; if something is not meant for you, it will cause you to stumble; only what truly belongs to you suits you best.""

The proverb emphasizes the importance of being content with what is rightfully yours, managing resources wisely, respecting others, and not pursuing things that aren't meant for you as they may lead to your downfall."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Kí ni Dáàró ní kó tó sọ pé olè-é kó òun?,What did Dáàró own before he claimed he was robbed?,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb into English step by step.

First, let me break down the proverb:
- ""Kí ni Dáàró ní kó tó sọ"" = ""What did Daaro say before saying""
- ""pé olè-é kó òun"" = ""that a thief has stolen from him/her""

""Dáàró"" appears to be a person's name in this proverb.

The complete literal translation would be: ""What did Daaro say before claiming that a thief has stolen from him?""

This proverb is questioning what evidence or circumstances preceded Daaro's claim of theft. The implied meaning is about questioning the basis of accusations or claims before accepting them. It suggests that we should investigate what happened before someone makes an accusation, as there might be important context or preceding events that explain the situation.

The English equivalent would be: ""What did Daaro say before claiming he was robbed?""

This proverb teaches the importance of considering the full context of a situation and not just accepting accusations at face value."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ẹlẹ́ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́ ńlọ ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́, o ní “Ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́gbẹ̀ta ni àbí ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́gbẹ̀fà?”; èwo lo gbé níbẹ̀?","A person says he has lost an unspecified amount of money, and you ask if the amount is five hundred cowries or eleven hundred cowries; which amount did you steal?","Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the proverb:
""Ẹlẹ́ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́ ńlọ ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́, o ní ""Ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́gbẹ̀ta ni àbí ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́gbẹ̀fà?""; èwo lo gbé níbẹ̀?""

2) Key elements:
- ""Ẹlẹ́ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́"" refers to someone who owns or sells ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́ (a type of pork/pig meat)
- ""ńlọ ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́"" means ""is going to sell/buy ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́""
- ""o ní"" means ""he/she says""
- ""Ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́gbẹ̀ta ni àbí ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́gbẹ̀fà?"" means ""Is it ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́ for 300 or ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́ for 600?""
- ""èwo lo gbé níbẹ̀?"" means ""which one did you take/choose there?""

3) English translation:
""A pork seller goes to sell pork and asks, 'Is it pork for 300 or pork for 600?'; which one did you take from there?""

4) The meaning/moral:
This proverb criticizes someone who presents options but is actually the only person with knowledge of the situation. It highlights the absurdity of asking others to choose between options when they have no basis for making a choice and you're the one with all the information.

In English, we might express a similar sentiment with: ""Don't ask others to make choices about matters only you understand."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ojú kì í pọ́n baálé ilé kó fọwọ́ gbálẹ̀ ilé ẹ̀.,A head of a household is never so hard up that he sweeps his compound with his bare hands.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb by breaking it down:

""Ojú kì í pọ́n baálé ilé kó fọwọ́ gbálẹ̀ ilé ẹ̀.""

Breaking down the components:
- ""Ojú kì í pọ́n"" = ""Eyes will not/should not be so irritated/troubled""
- ""baálé ilé"" = ""for the head/master of the house""
- ""kó fọwọ́ gbálẹ̀ ilé ẹ̀"" = ""that he uses his hands to sweep his own house/compound""

Putting it together, the literal translation would be:
""The eyes of the head of the house should not be so irritated that he uses his hands to sweep his own house.""

The English meaning of this proverb is:
""A person of high status should not be so desperate or frustrated that they perform tasks beneath their dignity or position.""

This proverb speaks to maintaining proper roles and dignity - suggesting that no matter how urgent a situation seems, certain people should maintain their position and delegate appropriate tasks to others rather than compromising their status."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"“Ẹ kú-ulé” ò yẹ ará ilé; “Ẹ kú atìbà” ò yẹni tí ńtàjò bọ̀; ẹni tí ò kí ẹni, “Kú atìbà”-á pàdánù “Ẹ kú-ulé.”","“Greetings to you, house-bound ones” is improper for the house-bound to utter; “Welcome home” is not proper for the person arriving from a trip; whoever fails to give “welcome” to the person returning does himself or herself out of “greetings, house-bound.”","# Translating a Yoruba Proverb

To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll analyze it piece by piece:

1. ""Ẹ kú-ulé"" ò yẹ ará ilé
   - ""Ẹ kú-ulé"" is a greeting that means ""welcome home"" or ""greetings to the household""
   - ""ò yẹ"" means ""is not appropriate for"" or ""doesn't suit""
   - ""ará ilé"" means ""member of the household"" or ""resident""

2. ""Ẹ kú atìbà"" ò yẹni tí ńtàjò bọ̀
   - ""Ẹ kú atìbà"" is a greeting for someone arriving or a visitor
   - ""ò yẹni"" means ""is not appropriate for""
   - ""tí ńtàjò bọ̀"" refers to someone who is leaving or departing

3. ẹni tí ò kí ẹni, ""Kú atìbà""-á pàdánù ""Ẹ kú-ulé""
   - ""ẹni tí ò kí ẹni"" means ""one who does not greet someone""
   - ""pàdánù"" means ""to lose"" or ""to miss out on""

## English Translation:
""'Welcome home' is not appropriate for a resident; 'Welcome visitor' is not appropriate for someone who is departing; one who fails to say 'Welcome visitor' will miss out on receiving 'Welcome home'.""

## Meaning:
This proverb teaches about reciprocity and proper social etiquette. It suggests that if you don't properly welcome others when they visit, you shouldn't expect to be welcomed when you visit them. Essentially, the way you treat others will determine how they treat you in return."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ẹran kí la ò jẹ rí? Ọ̀pọ̀lọ́ báni lábàtà ó ba búrúbúrú.,"What sort of meat is it, the likes of which one has never tasted? A toad comes upon one at the swamp and cowers in fright.","To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down step by step:

""Ẹran kí la ò jẹ rí?"" - This first part literally asks ""What meat have we not eaten before?"" which implies ""We've experienced many things in life.""

""Ọ̀pọ̀lọ́ báni lábàtà ó ba búrúbúrú."" - This part refers to encountering the toad (ọ̀pọ̀lọ́) wearing shoes (lábàtà), and the shoes being oversized or ill-fitting (búrúbúrú).

Putting these components together, the proverb is expressing surprise or disbelief at seeing something unusual or inappropriate.

English translation: ""What kind of meat haven't we eaten before? (Now) we see a toad wearing oversized shoes.""

The meaning: Just when you think you've seen everything in life, something even more surprising comes along. This proverb is used to express astonishment at unusual or inappropriate situations, similar to the English expression ""Now I've seen everything!"""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,A-binú-fùfù ní ńwá oúnjẹ fún a-binú-wẹ́rẹ́-wẹ́rẹ́.,A volatile-tempered person secures food for a mild-tempered person.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down by analyzing its components:

1. ""A-binú-fùfù"" - This refers to someone who gets angry quickly but whose anger also subsides quickly (literally ""one who gets angry like a gust of wind"")

2. ""ní ńwá oúnjẹ fún"" - means ""is the one who looks for/provides food for""

3. ""a-binú-wẹ́rẹ́-wẹ́rẹ́"" - This refers to someone whose anger builds slowly but lasts for a long time (literally ""one who gets angry slowly/steadily"")

Putting it all together, the proverb translates to:

""The person who angers quickly (but calms quickly) provides food for the person who angers slowly (but stays angry).""

The deeper meaning suggests that people with quick tempers who quickly forgive often end up serving or being taken advantage of by those who rarely get angry but hold grudges for a long time."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Pẹ̀tẹ̀pẹ́tẹ̀ Ìjèṣà, ó ta sẹ́ni lára kò wọ́n.",The mud of the Ìjèṣà: it splashes on one and will not be washed off.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) First, I'll identify the key parts:
   - ""Pẹ̀tẹ̀pẹ́tẹ̀ Ìjèṣà"" - This refers to a mild skin irritation or rash common among the Ijesha people (a Yoruba subgroup)
   - ""ó ta sẹ́ni lára"" - it affects someone's body
   - ""kò wọ́n"" - it's not expensive/costly

2) Putting the literal meaning together:
   ""The mild skin rash of Ijesha affects the body but is not costly/serious""

3) Understanding the deeper meaning:
   This proverb uses the metaphor of a minor skin condition to convey that something can be irritating or bothersome without being truly harmful or expensive to remedy.

4) The English translation with equivalent meaning would be:
   ""The Ijesha rash irritates the skin but isn't costly.""

The proverb essentially means that some problems may be annoying or uncomfortable but are ultimately minor and not worth significant concern or expense to address."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ta ní ńjẹun tájá ńjùrù?,At whose dinner table is the dog wagging its tail?,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down and analyze its components:

""Ta ní ńjẹun tájá ńjùrù?""

Breaking it down:
- ""Ta ní"" = ""Who is"" or ""Who's the one""
- ""ńjẹun"" = ""eating food"" (ń = present continuous marker, jẹun = to eat food)
- ""tá"" = ""that"" or ""while""
- ""já"" = ""dog""
- ""ńjùrù"" = ""is watching"" or ""is staring"" (again ń marks continuous action)

Putting it together literally: ""Who is eating food while the dog is staring/watching?""

The meaning of this proverb speaks to the awkwardness or impropriety of enjoying something in the presence of someone who lacks it or desires it. It highlights the discomfort of consuming resources while someone in need looks on.

English equivalent translation:
""Who can eat comfortably while a hungry dog watches?""

This proverb teaches about compassion, sharing, and being mindful of others' needs when you have plenty."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Afínjú ní ńjẹ iwọ; ọ̀mọ̀ràn ní ńjẹ obì; màrí-màjẹ ní ńjẹ awùsá.,It is a finicky person that eats iwọ;,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb by breaking it down piece by piece:

""Afínjú ní ńjẹ iwọ; ọ̀mọ̀ràn ní ńjẹ obì; màrí-màjẹ ní ńjẹ awùsá.""

Breaking it down:
- ""Afínjú ní ńjẹ iwọ"" = The fashionable/elegant person eats iwọ (a type of vegetable)
- ""ọ̀mọ̀ràn ní ńjẹ obì"" = The wise/knowledgeable person eats kola nut (obì)
- ""màrí-màjẹ ní ńjẹ awùsá"" = The impulsive/hasty person eats awusa (tiger nuts/groundnuts)

The proverb is talking about how different types of people have different preferences or choices based on their character.

English translation:
""The elegant person eats iwọ; the wise person eats kola nut; the impulsive person eats tiger nuts.""

The deeper meaning is that one's character determines one's choices or preferences. Different people gravitate toward different things according to their nature."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Bí a kò bá tó ìyà-á kọ̀ tí à ńkọ̀ ọ́, àjẹkún ìyà là ńjẹ.","If one lacks the means to reject suffering and attempts to reject it, one's suffering simply multiplies.","Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

First, let's break down the components:
- ""Bí a kò bá tó ìyà-á kọ̀ tí à ńkọ̀ ọ́"" - This part refers to not fully learning or accepting the suffering/lesson that one is being taught
- ""àjẹkún ìyà là ńjẹ"" - This part suggests continuing to suffer or experiencing prolonged suffering

The proverb is talking about the relationship between learning from hardship and continuing to suffer.

The English translation would be:
""If we don't learn from the suffering/lesson that we are being taught, we will continue to experience endless suffering.""

This proverb essentially means that if you don't learn from your initial difficulties or challenges, you're destined to face prolonged or repeated hardship. It emphasizes the importance of learning from life's lessons quickly to avoid continuous suffering."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,A kì í bọ òrìṣà lójú ọ̀fọ́n-ọ̀n; bó bá dalẹ́ a máa tú pẹpẹ.,"One does not sacrifice to a god in the presence of a house rat; otherwise, when night falls it invades the rafter shelves.","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the components:
- ""A kì í bọ òrìṣà lójú ọ̀fọ́n-ọ̀n"" - This first part refers to not worshipping/making offerings to a deity (òrìṣà) during a time of scarcity (ọ̀fọ́n-ọ̀n refers to a period of hunger or lack)
- ""bó bá dalẹ́"" - When prosperity/abundance comes
- ""a máa tú pẹpẹ"" - One will build/set up a proper altar

Putting it together:
""One does not worship the deity during times of scarcity; when prosperity comes, one will build a proper altar.""

The meaning conveys that people often neglect spiritual obligations during hard times but become devoted when prosperity returns. It speaks to the inconsistency of fair-weather devotion or opportunistic faith."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ìwọ̀sí ní,X,"To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll need to analyze its components and meaning.

However, I notice that ""Ìwọ̀sí ní"" appears to be incomplete or potentially not a standard Yoruba proverb in its complete form. 

The phrase contains:
- ""Ìwọ̀sí"" - which could relate to ""movement toward"" or ""leaning toward""
- ""ní"" - which is often used as ""is"" or ""has"" in Yoruba

Without additional context or the complete proverb, I cannot provide an accurate translation. A complete Yoruba proverb would typically have a full statement or message.

If you intended to share a different or complete proverb, please provide the full text, and I'll be happy to translate it step by step."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Àgbà tí kò lẹ́sẹ̀ nílẹ̀ a lọ́gbọ́n nínú.,An elder that has no substance should have cunning.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the words in the proverb:
- ""Àgbà"" = elder, older person
- ""tí"" = who, that
- ""kò"" = does not, doesn't
- ""lẹ́sẹ̀"" = have feet/legs
- ""nílẹ̀"" = on the ground
- ""a"" = will, shall
- ""lọ́gbọ́n"" = have wisdom
- ""nínú"" = inside, within

Putting it together literally: ""An elder who doesn't have feet/legs on the ground will have wisdom inside.""

Now, let me interpret the meaning:
This proverb uses a metaphorical contrast. It suggests that even if an elder is physically limited (cannot walk or move around easily), they compensate with inner wisdom. It emphasizes that physical limitations don't diminish one's intellectual capacity or wisdom gained through experience.

The English translation would be:
""An elder who cannot stand may still be rich in wisdom.""

This proverb teaches that we shouldn't judge people by their physical abilities but rather recognize that wisdom and intelligence can exist regardless of physical limitations."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"À ńjá ìbàǹtẹ́ ẹ̀ lẹ́hìn, ó ńjá tará iwájú.","His loincloth is being stripped from behind, yet he is stripping those of the people ahead of him.","Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

First, I'll break down the words:
- ""À ńjá"" = ""One is tearing/cutting""
- ""ìbàǹtẹ́"" = ""cloth/wrapper""
- ""ẹ̀ lẹ́hìn"" = ""at the back/behind""
- ""ó ńjá"" = ""he/she is tearing/cutting""
- ""tará iwájú"" = ""that of the front/person in front""

Putting it together literally: ""One is tearing/cutting cloth at the back, he/she is tearing that of the person in front.""

The meaning in English would be: ""While one tears the cloth from behind, one is also tearing the cloth of the person in front.""

This proverb conveys that our actions often have consequences beyond what we intend. When you harm others, you may inadvertently harm yourself or those connected to you. It's similar to the English saying ""What goes around comes around"" - highlighting the interconnectedness of human actions and their consequences.

The English translation of this Yoruba proverb is: ""As one tears the cloth from behind, one is also tearing the cloth of the person in front."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ẹ̀yá ló bí mi, ẹkùn ló wò mí dàgbà, ológìnní gbà mí tọ́; bí kò sẹ́ran lọ́bẹ̀ nkò jẹ.","I was born of a monkey; I was raised by a leopard, I was adopted by a cat; if there is no meat in the stew I will not eat it.","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb into English by breaking it down step by step.

The proverb is: ""Ẹ̀yá ló bí mi, ẹkùn ló wò mí dàgbà, ológìnní gbà mí tọ́; bí kò sẹ́ran lọ́bẹ̀ nkò jẹ.""

Breaking it down:
- ""Ẹ̀yá ló bí mi"" = The monkey gave birth to me
- ""ẹkùn ló wò mí dàgbà"" = the tiger raised me to adulthood
- ""ológìnní gbà mí tọ́"" = the cat took me in/trained me
- ""bí kò sẹ́ran lọ́bẹ̀ nkò jẹ"" = if there is no meat in the stew, I won't eat it

Putting it together in English:
""I was born of a monkey, raised by a tiger, and trained by a cat; if there's no meat in the stew, I won't eat it.""

The meaning: This proverb speaks to someone who comes from a background of ferocity or wildness (raised among wild animals) and therefore has developed particular tastes or standards. It suggests that someone with such a background can't be expected to settle for less than what they consider worthy or appropriate."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"À-jẹ-tán, à-jẹ-ì-mọra, ká fi ọwọ́ mẹ́wẹ̀ẹ̀wá jẹun ò yẹ ọmọ èèyàn.","Eating-absolutely-everything, eating-with-abandon, eating with all ten fingers is unworthy of human beings.","I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the components:
- ""À-jẹ-tán, à-jẹ-ì-mọra"" - This refers to eating completely/excessively without restraint or moderation
- ""ká fi ọwọ́ mẹ́wẹ̀ẹ̀wá jẹun"" - using all ten fingers to eat
- ""ò yẹ ọmọ èèyàn"" - is not befitting for a human being/person

The proverb is speaking about restraint, moderation, and proper conduct. It suggests that excessive consumption or greed (symbolized by eating with all ten fingers) is unbecoming of a person with dignity.

English translation:
""Eating excessively and without restraint, using all ten fingers to eat, is not befitting of a human being.""

The deeper meaning conveys that moderation and self-control in our consumption and desires is an important aspect of being civilized and dignified."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Òkùnkùn ò mẹni ọ̀wọ̀; ó dÍfá fún “Ìwọ́ tá nìyẹn”?,Darkness does not know who deserves deference; it consulted the oracle Ifá for “Who might you be?”,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the proverb:
   - ""Òkùnkùn ò mẹni ọ̀wọ̀"" - The first part seems to talk about darkness not recognizing or respecting someone
   - ""ó dÍfá fún"" - This part means ""it consulted Ifa divination for"" or ""it performed Ifa for""
   - ""Ìwọ́ tá nìyẹn"" - This appears to be ""Is that you?"" or ""Are you the one?""

2) Analyzing the meaning:
   The proverb appears to be using the metaphor of darkness not showing respect or recognition, and connecting it to a divination context, asking if someone is identified.

3) Complete translation:
   ""Darkness does not recognize/respect anyone; (yet) it performed divination for 'Is that you?'""

The meaning likely conveys that in situations where there's no clear visibility (literal darkness or metaphorical obscurity), people still try to identify or recognize others, highlighting the irony of seeking identification in circumstances where recognition is impossible."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Bí ayá bá mojú ọkọ, alárìnnà a yẹsẹ̀.","When the wife has got to know the husband, the marriage broker makes way.","Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the components:
   - ""Bí ayá bá mojú ọkọ"" - This first part refers to a wife recognizing or knowing her husband's face/expression
   - ""alárìnnà a yẹsẹ̀"" - This second part refers to a visitor or middleman withdrawing or stepping back

2) Word by word analysis:
   - ""Bí"" = If
   - ""ayá"" = wife
   - ""bá mojú"" = recognizes the face/mood
   - ""ọkọ"" = husband
   - ""alárìnnà"" = visitor/middleman/intermediary
   - ""a yẹsẹ̀"" = will step back/withdraw

3) Putting it together in English:
""If a wife understands her husband's mood/expressions, the visitor/middleman will step back.""

4) Contextual meaning:
This proverb speaks to the intimate understanding between spouses. When a wife knows how to read her husband's mood or expressions, there's no need for outsiders to intervene or mediate between them.

English translation: ""When a wife understands her husband's expressions, the middleman withdraws."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ẹni à ńgbé gẹ̀gẹ̀ ni yó ba ara-a rẹ̀ jẹ́.,It is the person who is revered that will disgrace himself or herself.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb by breaking it down:

""Ẹni à ńgbé gẹ̀gẹ̀ ni yó ba ara-a rẹ̀ jẹ́.""

Breaking it down:
- ""Ẹni"" = the person who/whom
- ""à ńgbé"" = is being carried or lifted
- ""gẹ̀gẹ̀"" = carelessly/haphazardly
- ""ni"" = is the one who
- ""yó ba ara-a rẹ̀ jẹ́"" = will spoil or harm themselves

Putting it together: ""The person who is being carried carelessly is the one who will harm themselves.""

The meaning of this proverb suggests that when someone is receiving poor or careless treatment (being ""carried carelessly""), they will ultimately suffer the consequences themselves. It speaks to personal responsibility even in situations where others are handling you improperly.

English equivalent translation: ""The one who is carried carelessly will be the one to suffer the harm."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Tẹ̀tẹ̀ kì í tẹ́.,Spinach is never disgraced.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down and analyze it:

The proverb is ""Tẹ̀tẹ̀ kì í tẹ́.""

Step 1: Identify the key words
- ""Tẹ̀tẹ̀"" refers to persistence, diligence, or consistent effort
- ""kì í"" is a negative marker meaning ""does not"" or ""never""
- ""tẹ́"" means ""to be in vain"" or ""to fail""

Step 2: Understand the literal construction
Literally, it's saying ""Persistence never fails"" or ""Diligence does not end in vain""

Step 3: Capture the meaning in natural English
The proverb means that consistent effort and persistence will eventually yield results. It emphasizes that if you keep trying diligently, your efforts will not be wasted.

English translation: ""Persistence never fails"" or ""Consistent effort always yields results.""

This proverb encourages perseverance and steady work toward one's goals, assuring that such dedication will eventually lead to success."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Ẹní bá dẹ ojú-u rẹ̀ sílẹ̀ á rímú-u rẹ̀.,Whoever gazes downwards with will see his or her nose.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down into parts and then provide the English equivalent.

Step 1: Analyze the components
- ""Ẹní bá dẹ ojú-u rẹ̀ sílẹ̀"" = ""The person who looks downward/lowers their eyes""
- ""á rímú-u rẹ̀"" = ""will see their nose""

Step 2: Understand the literal meaning
The literal translation is: ""Whoever looks down will see their nose.""

Step 3: Interpret the deeper meaning
This proverb suggests that when you focus your attention downward (or on yourself), you'll only see what's directly in front of you (your nose). 

Step 4: Determine the equivalent English meaning
The proverb teaches about self-awareness and perspective. It suggests that if you only look at things from your own limited perspective, you'll only see what's immediately apparent to you, missing the bigger picture.

English translation: ""Whoever looks down will see their nose.""

Equivalent meaning: ""If you only look inward, you'll only see yourself,"" suggesting that a narrow focus leads to limited understanding."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Onígẹ̀gẹ́ fìlẹ̀kẹ̀ dọ́pọ̀; onílẹ̀kẹ̀ ìbá gbowo, ko rọ́rùn fìlẹ̀kẹ̀ so.",The person with goitre offers a ridiculously low price for beads; were the beads seller to accept her offer she would have no neck to string the beads around.,"Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, I'll break down the key terms in the proverb:
- ""Onígẹ̀gẹ́"" - the owner of gẹ̀gẹ́ (a type of bead)
- ""fìlẹ̀kẹ̀ dọ́pọ̀"" - threads/strings beads together
- ""onílẹ̀kẹ̀"" - the owner of beads/the person who wears beads
- ""ìbá gbowo"" - would get/receive money
- ""ko rọ́rùn fìlẹ̀kẹ̀ so"" - it is not easy to string beads

Putting it together, the proverb can be translated as:

""The bead maker strings beads together; if the wearer of beads had money, they would realize it's not easy to string beads.""

The meaning conveys that people often don't appreciate the difficulty of skilled work until they try to do it themselves. It suggests that we should value craftspeople and their expertise, as what looks simple to consumers often requires significant skill and effort to produce."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Bí a bá ti mọ là ńdé; a-láì-lẹ́ṣin kì í dé wọ̀nwọ̀n.,One arrives according to one's worth; a horseless person does not arrive with the noise of hoofs and stirrups.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step:

First part: ""Bí a bá ti mọ là ńdé""
- ""Bí"" means ""as,"" ""if,"" or ""the way that""
- ""a bá ti mọ"" means ""one knows"" or ""according to one's capacity/knowledge""
- ""là ńdé"" means ""is how one arrives"" or ""is how one presents oneself""

Second part: ""a-láì-lẹ́ṣin kì í dé wọ̀nwọ̀n""
- ""a-láì-lẹ́ṣin"" means ""one who doesn't have a horse"" or ""one without resources""
- ""kì í dé wọ̀nwọ̀n"" means ""doesn't arrive at the same time"" or ""cannot arrive in style/grandly""

Putting it together, the proverb means:

""One arrives according to one's means; a person without a horse cannot arrive in grandeur.""

The English equivalent meaning would be:
""We present ourselves according to our capabilities; a person without resources cannot make a grand appearance.""

This proverb teaches about recognizing our limitations and living within our means, while acknowledging that different people have different resources and capabilities."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,“Mo mọ̀wọ̀n ara-à mi” kì í ṣẹ̀rẹ̀kẹ́ èébú.,“I am jealous of my dignity” does not hurl insults at others.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.

First, let me break down the components:
- ""Mo mọ̀wọ̀n ara-à mi"" = ""I know my worth/limits"" or ""I know my place""
- ""kì í ṣẹ̀rẹ̀kẹ́ èébú"" = ""is not an insult"" or ""is not a form of abuse""

The proverb ""Mo mọ̀wọ̀n ara-à mi"" kì í ṣẹ̀rẹ̀kẹ́ èébú"" essentially means:

""'I know my place/worth' is not an insult.""

The deeper meaning conveys that acknowledging one's limitations or understanding one's position in life is not a sign of weakness or something to be ashamed of. Rather, it's a mark of wisdom and self-awareness.

English translation: ""Knowing one's limitations is not a disgrace."""
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,A kì í bá ọba pàlà kí ọkọ́ ọba má ṣàn-ánni lẹ́sẹ̀.,One does not share a farm boundary with a king without getting one's feet gashed by the king's hoe.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll analyze its components and cultural context.

Step 1: Breaking down the proverb's parts:
- ""A kì í"" = One does not/should not
- ""bá ọba pàlà"" = share boundaries/land with the king
- ""kí ọkọ́ ọba"" = without the king's hoe/farm tool
- ""má ṣàn-ánni lẹ́sẹ̀"" = striking/hitting one's foot

Step 2: Understanding the literal meaning:
The proverb literally says ""One should not share boundaries with the king without the king's hoe striking one's foot.""

Step 3: Interpreting the cultural meaning:
This proverb speaks to power dynamics and proximity to authority. It suggests that if you live close to or associate with powerful people (the king), you will inevitably experience some consequences or interference from their authority (the king's hoe hitting your foot).

Step 4: Finding an English equivalent:
The English translation would be:
""If you share a boundary with the king, his hoe will surely strike your foot.""

The deeper meaning: When you associate closely with powerful people or authorities, you cannot avoid being affected by their influence or power, sometimes negatively."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Bí eegbọ́n bá ṣo ayínrín nímú, adìẹ kọ́ ni yó ja.","If a tick clings to a fox's nose, it is not a chicken that will remove it.","Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the proverb: ""Bí eegbọ́n bá ṣo ayínrín nímú, adìẹ kọ́ ni yó ja.""

2) Translating each component:
   - ""Bí eegbọ́n bá"" = ""If an elder/older person""
   - ""ṣo ayínrín nímú"" = ""puts mucus/snot in their nose""
   - ""adìẹ kọ́ ni yó ja"" = ""it is not a chicken that will fight it/remove it""

3) The literal translation is: ""If an elder puts mucus in their nose, it is not a chicken that will fight/remove it.""

4) Understanding the meaning: This proverb is about respecting hierarchy and knowing one's place. It suggests that when a superior person (elder) does something wrong or inappropriate, it's not the place of someone with lower status (symbolized by the chicken) to correct or challenge them.

5) The English equivalent would be: ""If an elder puts mucus in their nose, it is not a chicken's place to challenge/confront them.""

The proverb teaches about respecting authority structures while acknowledging that even those in authority can make mistakes, but it's important to know who has the standing to address those mistakes."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,À-sẹ́-kú làgbàlagbà ńsẹ́ ọ̀ràn.,Denying-until-death is the way a venerable person denies a matter.,"I'll translate this Yoruba proverb into English by analyzing it step by step.

First, let me break down the components:
- ""À-sẹ́-kú"" - This appears to be a construction meaning ""one who has not died"" or ""having not died""
- ""làgbàlagbà"" - This combines ""li"" (is) and ""agbalagba"" (elder/elderly person)
- ""ńsẹ́"" - is doing/handling
- ""ọ̀ràn"" - matter/issue/affair

Putting these components together, the literal translation would be:
""It is because they have not died that elders handle matters.""

The idiomatic English translation would be:
""It is by virtue of staying alive that elders handle affairs.""

The meaning of this proverb is that experience comes with age and survival. Elders are able to handle matters wisely precisely because they have lived long enough to gain the necessary wisdom and experience. It emphasizes the value of the knowledge that comes with age and longevity."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Ìṣẹ̀ ò ti ibìkan mú ẹni; ìyà ò tibìkan jẹ èèyàn; bí o bá rìnrìn òṣì, bí o bá ojú ìṣẹ́ wọ̀lú, igbá-kúgbá ni wọn ó fi bu omi fún ẹ mu.","Destitution does not attach to one at a particular place; suffering does not attack a person at a particular place; if one walks like a wretch into a town, if one looks like a loser when one enters a town, it is with a miserable calabash that the people will offer one water to drink.","# Translating a Yoruba Proverb

Let me break down this Yoruba proverb and translate it step by step:

1. ""Ìṣẹ̀ ò ti ibìkan mú ẹni"" - Poverty/hardship does not come from one specific place to get a person

2. ""ìyà ò tibìkan jẹ èèyàn"" - Suffering does not come from one specific place to afflict a person

3. ""bí o bá rìnrìn òṣì, bí o bá ojú ìṣẹ́ wọ̀lú"" - If you wander in poverty, if you enter town with the face of hardship/poverty

4. ""igbá-kúgbá ni wọn ó fi bu omi fún ẹ mu"" - They will give you water to drink in any kind of calabash/container (implying poor or improper vessels)

The complete English translation would be:

**""Poverty doesn't come from one place to afflict a person; suffering doesn't come from one specific source; if you walk around in poverty, if you enter town looking destitute, they will serve you water in just any calabash.""**

The proverb essentially means that when you appear poor or needy, people will treat you with little respect or dignity. It speaks to how society often treats those in unfortunate circumstances."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Oòrùn, kó tìẹ wọ̀ ká má bàá Ọlọ́jọ́ wí.","Sun, go set so one does not blame the owner of the day.","Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:

1) Breaking down the components:
   - ""Oòrùn"" = sun
   - ""kó tìẹ wọ̀"" = should set/go down
   - ""ká má bàá Ọlọ́jọ́ wí"" = so that we don't have to blame/quarrel with the owner/master of the day

2) Putting it together literally:
   ""The sun should set so that we don't have to blame the owner of the day.""

3) Understanding the meaning:
   This proverb suggests that things should follow their natural course or timing. Just as the sun naturally sets at the end of the day, we should allow events to conclude naturally rather than forcing outcomes or blaming those in authority when things don't go exactly as we want.

English translation: ""The sun must set so that we don't blame the owner of the day.""

The cultural meaning implies acceptance of natural processes and timing rather than rushing or complaining about things we cannot control."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,"Mo dàgbà mo dàgó, aré ọmọdé ò tán lójúù mi.","I have become old and wise, but childish play has not ceased to appeal to me.","To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down phrase by phrase:

""Mo dàgbà mo dàgó"" - This means ""I have grown old, I have grown aged/mature""

""aré ọmọdé"" - This refers to ""the playfulness/games of children"" or ""children's play""

""ò tán lójúù mi"" - This means ""has not ended in my eyes"" or ""I still appreciate/understand""

Putting it all together, the English translation would be:

""Though I have grown old, I still appreciate the playfulness of children.""

The meaning behind this proverb is that despite aging, one should maintain connection with youthful energy and not lose the ability to understand or appreciate the enthusiasm and playfulness of the younger generation. It speaks to wisdom that includes maintaining perspective across generations."
ZeroShot-CoT,Anthropic,Olóbìnrin kan kì í pagbo ìja.,A person who has only  one wife does not form a circle for a fight.,"To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step.

First, let me analyze the components:
- ""Olóbìnrin"" means ""woman"" or ""a woman""
- ""kan"" means ""one"" or ""a single""
- ""kì í"" is a negative marker meaning ""does not"" or ""cannot""
- ""pa"" means ""to kill"" or ""to finish""
- ""agbo"" means ""herd"" or ""group""
- ""ìja"" means ""fight"" or ""quarrel""

Putting these together literally: ""A single woman cannot end/finish a group/herd of fights.""

The meaning of this proverb is: ""A single woman cannot resolve all disputes"" or more idiomatically, ""One woman cannot settle all quarrels.""

The proverb essentially conveys that some problems or disputes are too large or complex for one person to resolve alone, particularly emphasizing that even with a woman's traditionally recognized role in mediation and peacekeeping in Yoruba culture, there are limits to what one person can accomplish."

English: Only what is not sold in the market will a slave not eat.

English: A child who has never seen soup before is storing up palm oil in his chest.

This proverb is commenting on someone who acts inappropriately or wastefully because they lack experience or knowledge. Just as a child who has never seen proper soup might misuse valuable palm oil (by storing it on their chest rather than using it correctly in cooking), so too might inexperienced people mishandle valuable resources or opportunities due to their ignorance."

English: What is in the father's hand does not easily pass to the child's hand.

This proverb suggests that wealth, power, or possessions that belong to the father (or older generation) aren't automatically or easily transferred to the child (or younger generation).

FewShot,Anthropic,Ìbàjẹ́ ọjọ́ kan ò tán bọ̀rọ̀.,The disgrace one incurs in one day does not disappear that soon.,"English: The damage of one day does not end quickly/easily.

This Yoruba proverb suggests that the consequences of a single day's misfortune or bad actions can have lasting effects that aren't quickly resolved. It conveys the idea that negative impacts can persist long after the initial event."

English: Where we are being told stories before inheriting, we should know that the inheritance there doesn't affect us.

This proverb suggests that if someone has to be told stories or given explanations before receiving an inheritance, they should understand that the inheritance may not truly belong to them or benefit them.

FewShot,Anthropic,Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ò mẹ̀yẹ.,A pig does not know what is becoming.,"Yoruba: Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ò mẹ̀yẹ.

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""Ìwọ̀n eku nìwọ̀n ìtẹ́; olongo kì í gbé tìmùtìmù"" translates to ""The size of the mouse determines the size of the trap; a lizard does not take up excessive space."" It teaches the importance of living within one's means and not pretending to be more than you are. This reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on appropriate behavior according to one's social position, advocating for modesty and authenticity rather than pretentiousness or excess."

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""A bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind the chicken coop.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Àfòpiná tó ní òun ó pa fìtílà, ara ẹ̀ ni yó pa"" translates to ""The wind that claims it will extinguish the lamp will only destroy itself.""
2. This phrase warns against overestimating one's abilities or challenging forces beyond one's capacity.
3. It suggests that attempting to perform tasks beyond one's natural abilities can lead to self-destruction or failure.
4. This connects to our proverb about the bird comparing itself to a vulture - both involve pretension and its consequences.

Interim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces that our proverb is about the dangers of pretension and attempting to assume a status or role beyond one's natural capacity.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""A bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind the chicken coop.""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against pretension and attempting to claim a status or position beyond one's true capacity. In Yoruba culture, the vulture (igún) is a large, powerful bird with a certain status, while sleeping behind a chicken coop represents a lowly, undignified position. The proverb teaches that those who falsely elevate themselves or pretend to be more important than they are will ultimately find themselves in embarrassing or undignified circumstances. It emphasizes the importance of authenticity and accepting one's true position in life rather than pretending to be something one is not.
- References: Similar Phrase 1 warns about consequences of overstepping social boundaries, while Similar Phrase 2 cautions against challenging forces beyond one's capacity.

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""Ẹyẹ tó fi ara wé igún, ẹ̀hìn àdìrò ní ńsùn"" translates to ""A bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind the chicken coop."" It teaches that those who pretend to be more important than they truly are will ultimately end up in undignified circumstances. In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb encourages authenticity and self-awareness rather than false pretension or imitation of those with higher status. It reminds us that pretending to be something we are not often leads to embarrassment or failure."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Àgbéré àwòdì ní ńní òun ó jẹ ìgbín"" translates roughly to ""The promiscuous hawk claims it will eat the snail."" This is a proverb about making empty boasts or impossible claims.
2. A hawk cannot easily eat a snail because of the snail's protective shell, so this represents an idle or meaningless boast.
3. This suggests our target proverb may also deal with unrealistic claims or someone overestimating their abilities.
4. Both proverbs appear to use animal or natural imagery to convey lessons about human behavior and limitations.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely addresses someone making unrealistic claims or promises they cannot fulfill, possibly using metaphorical language about animals or natural elements.

Similar Phrase 2: Ẹnìkan kì í jẹ́ ""Àwá dé.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ẹnìkan kì í jẹ́ 'Àwá dé'"" translates to ""One person cannot be 'We have arrived'"" or ""A single person cannot claim to be a group.""
2. This proverb emphasizes that one person cannot represent or speak for many, highlighting limitations of individual claims or representation.
3. This adds context to our main proverb by suggesting it's not just about boastfulness but about the limits of individual capability versus collective action.
4. The grasshopper proverb and this phrase both question inappropriate claims of capability or representation.

Interim Insight: The second phrase confirms our proverb addresses the mismatch between claimed abilities and actual capabilities, specifically questioning individual claims to accomplish tasks that might require collective effort.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The grasshopper claims it can clear the path; who would follow the path cleared by a grasshopper?""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes those who make grand claims beyond their actual capabilities. A grasshopper is too small to effectively clear a path that would be useful to others, just as some people boast about abilities they don't possess. The proverb questions not just the boast itself but also suggests that even if such claims were true, they would be of little value to others. It teaches humility and warns against following those who make unrealistic promises. In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to caution against following unreliable leaders or believing in empty promises.

- References: The first similar phrase about the hawk and snail reinforces the theme of impossible boasts, while the second phrase about one person not being ""we"" emphasizes the limitations of individual claims versus collective responsibility.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Àwúrèbeé ní òún lè yẹ̀nà; ta ní jẹ́ tọ ọ̀nà àwúrèbe?"" translates to ""The grasshopper claims it can clear the path; who would follow the path cleared by a grasshopper?"" It warns against both making claims beyond one's capabilities and trusting those who make such unrealistic boasts. In Yoruba wisdom, this teaches discernment in choosing who to follow and cautions against self-aggrandizement."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This similar phrase contains scenarios where different entities ""tẹ́ lọ́wọ́"" (land in the hands of) different people or things: the yam lands with the yam owner, the lizard lands on the wall, and the turtle lands in ""my"" hands.
2. The repetition of ""tẹ́ lọ́wọ́"" (landing in someone's hands) suggests a pattern of things naturally returning to where they belong or finding their rightful place.
3. The phrase illustrates natural consequences and inherent relationships between entities.

Interim Insight: The word ""tẹ́"" in this context relates to landing, settling, or ending up in someone's hands or possession. The similar phrase suggests that things ultimately find their natural or appropriate place.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This phrase suggests that a person of mixed heritage is never without resources - if the mother doesn't have wealth/words, the father will have money in hand.
2. It emphasizes self-reliance through family connections and acknowledges multiple sources of support.
3. The phrase ""lówó lọ́wọ́"" (having money in hand) relates to our proverb's focus on ""lọ́wọ́"" (in the hands), reinforcing the importance of personal possession and self-sufficiency.

Interim Insight: This second phrase emphasizes self-reliance and personal resources, suggesting that one should depend on oneself rather than on others, which aligns with our main proverb's message of self-dependence.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""Don't depend on the homeowner, don't depend on the visitor; depend on yourself.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the value of self-reliance and personal responsibility in Yoruba culture. It advises against depending on others, whether they are hosts (homeowners) or guests (visitors), suggesting that true security comes from depending on oneself. The proverb reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on independence, self-sufficiency, and taking responsibility for one's own affairs. In a community-oriented culture, this proverb interestingly highlights the importance of individual agency while acknowledging the social context of homeowners and visitors.

- References: The first similar phrase reinforces how things naturally belong in certain places, suggesting we too should rely on our natural resources. The second phrase supports the theme of self-reliance by showing how one should leverage their own connections and resources rather than depending on others."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Igúnnugún bà lé òrùlé; ojú tó ilé ó tó oko"" translates roughly to ""The vulture perches on the roof; eyes that can see the house can see the farm."" This suggests a relationship between hierarchy, visibility, and inevitability.
2. This phrase uses natural imagery (vulture, house, farm) to express a principle about how things that are obvious or powerful cannot be ignored.
3. The vulture perching on the roof is highly visible and significant - suggesting prominence and unavoidable presence.

Interim Insight: This similar phrase suggests the main proverb may deal with hierarchies of power or visibility, where certain forces or entities dominate others in ways that cannot be avoided or denied.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""One masquerade surpasses another masquerade; one deity surpasses another deity; The red cloth (or leopard) forces the Shango devotee into the bush.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The phrase ""Eégún ò na obìnrin lágọ̀; obìnrín tú kíjìpá ìdí-i rẹ̀, ó fi na eégún"" translates to ""The masquerade does not whip a woman in the gathering; the woman untied her wrapper and used it to whip the masquerade."" 
2. This phrase illustrates that even powerful cultural entities like the eégún (masquerade) have limitations and can be challenged by those presumed weaker (women).
3. It suggests a subversion of expected power dynamics in Yoruba culture - even sacred figures have vulnerabilities.

Interim Insight: This contextualizes our main proverb by suggesting that hierarchies of power (even spiritual ones) are not absolute. There are circumstances where even the most powerful entities must yield to others or face consequences.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""One masquerade surpasses another masquerade; one deity surpasses another deity; The red cloth forces the Shango devotee into the bush.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the relativity of power and authority, even among spiritual beings. In Yoruba cosmology, both eégún (ancestral masquerades) and òrìṣà (deities) exist in hierarchies where some are more powerful than others. The third part refers to how even a Shango devotee (a powerful deity of thunder) can be forced to retreat when confronted with certain symbols or powers (the pààká or red cloth, which may represent a competing spiritual force or taboo). 

  The proverb teaches humility by reminding us that no matter how powerful someone or something is, there is always something more powerful. Even spiritual authorities have their limitations and must sometimes yield to greater forces. This reflects the Yoruba understanding of a complex, interconnected universe where power is relative rather than absolute.

- References: The vulture imagery in Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the visibility of power hierarchies, while Similar Phrase 2 demonstrates how even sacred institutions have boundaries and can be challenged under certain circumstances.

Final Answer: This Yoruba proverb illustrates the relativity of power in both spiritual and worldly realms. It reveals that hierarchies exist everywhere—even among masquerades and deities—and reminds us that no one is supreme in all situations. The imagery of a Shango devotee being forced into the bush by a red cloth (pààká) demonstrates how even powerful figures have their vulnerabilities and must sometimes retreat. The proverb ultimately teaches humility and respect for the complex power dynamics that govern both the spiritual and physical worlds in Yoruba cosmology."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ta ní mọ Òkolo lÓyọ̀ọ́?"" translates to ""Who knows Okolo in Oyo?"" This is typically used to indicate someone or something insignificant or unknown in a big place.
2. This phrase suggests themes of recognition, identity, and status within a community.
3. It hints at the importance of self-awareness and knowing one's place in society.

Interim Insight: The first proverb suggests that in Yoruba culture, understanding one's social position is important. This relates to our main proverb which appears to address behaviors around food and satisfaction, possibly highlighting individualistic versus communal attitudes.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""I am full"" means ""I am full,"" ""I refuse"" means ""I refuse""; eating alone, (this is) an elder with selfish character.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Mo mỌ̀bàrà mo mỌ̀fún"" ti kì í jẹ́ kí àwòko kọ́ ọ̀pẹ́ẹ̀rẹ́ nÍfá"" roughly translates to ""Saying 'I know this, I know that' prevents the parrot from learning Ifa divination.""
2. This proverb warns against pride and over-confidence that prevents learning and growth.
3. It emphasizes the value of humility and openness to continued learning in Yoruba wisdom traditions.

Interim Insight: This phrase highlights how self-satisfaction and pride can prevent growth and proper social conduct. This connects to our main proverb by reinforcing that selfish behavior (like eating alone) reflects poorly on one's character, especially for someone who should know better (an elder).

## Final Synthesis:

- Final Translation: ""When I say 'I am satisfied,' it means I am truly satisfied; when I say 'I decline,' it means I truly decline; one who eats alone is an elder with a selfish character.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes selfish behavior, particularly around food sharing which is sacred in African cultures. It specifically condemns elders who eat alone, as they should be exemplars of community values. In Yoruba society, sharing food is a fundamental expression of community, and refusing to share (especially by respected elders) represents a serious moral failing. The proverb teaches that true wisdom includes generosity and community-mindedness, not just age or status. It warns against self-centered attitudes that place individual satisfaction above communal welfare.

- References: The first similar phrase (""Who knows Okolo in Oyo?"") reminds us of the importance of social recognition and proper conduct within the community. The second phrase about the parrot unable to learn Ifa reinforces how pride and self-satisfaction prevent proper growth and social development, much like the selfish elder who eats alone has failed to develop proper character despite their age.

Final Answer: The proverb criticizes selfishness, particularly in elders who should know better. In Yoruba culture, eating alone is considered deeply selfish, as sharing food is a fundamental social obligation. The proverb uses the contrast between personal satisfaction (""I am full"") and social responsibility to teach that true wisdom includes generosity, not just age. It serves as a warning against putting individual desires above community welfare."

2. This phrase emphasizes the responsibility of elders to guide, correct, and maintain proper order in society.
3. It reinforces the cultural expectation that elders should model proper behavior and wisdom.
4. Both proverbs start with ""Àgbà"" (elder), indicating they speak to the expected standards for elders in Yoruba society.

Interim Insight: The proverb emphasizes the inconsistency of an elder who maintains cleanliness (washing hands) but then contradicts this proper behavior with an improper claim or action (saying they'll eat with dirty hands anyway).

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""An elder doesn't finish washing their hands and then claim they will eat with dirty hands.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the importance of consistency in character and actions, especially for elders who should exemplify wisdom. It criticizes hypocrisy and self-contradiction, particularly when someone does something right (washing hands) but then undermines it with contradictory words or actions. In Yoruba culture, elders are expected to be role models and demonstrate wisdom through consistent behavior. The proverb can be applied to situations where people contradict their own positive actions with inappropriate claims or behaviors, teaching that integrity requires alignment between our actions and words.

- References: Both similar phrases reinforce Yoruba cultural values regarding proper behavior, particularly for elders. The first phrase addresses self-deception, while the second emphasizes elders' responsibility to maintain proper standards. Together, they frame the proverb within the broader Yoruba ethical framework of wisdom, consistency, and integrity.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Àgbàlagbà kì í wẹwọ́ tán kó ní òun ó jẹ si"" translates to ""An elder doesn't finish washing their hands and then claim they will eat with dirty hands.""

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Ẹni à bá tà ká fowó-o rẹ̀ ra àtùpà: ó ní òun à-jí-tanná-wò-lóru"" appears to follow the same structure as our target proverb.
2. This phrase involves someone being sold, with the money used to buy a lamp (àtùpà), and then the person claiming they'll be waking up to light the lamp at night.
3. The structure suggests irony - someone in a bad situation (being sold into slavery) yet claiming they'll have a responsibility or burden (lighting lamps at night).
4. This helps understand that the proverb likely deals with ironic situations where someone suffers a major loss yet focuses on a minor inconvenience.

Interim Insight: The proverb uses the literary device of irony to comment on human tendency to miss the bigger picture when facing hardship.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""The person who is sold and the money is used to buy a machete: he says the machete is causing him suffering.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The second similar phrase ""Ẹni à bá tà ká fowó-o rẹ̀ ra èbù: ó ní èlé òún kó ọ̀ọ́dúnrún"" continues the pattern of irony.
2. Here, someone is sold and the money is used to buy yams (èbù), and then the person complains about having to count five hundred yams.
3. This reinforces the theme of misplaced concern - being more worried about a minor inconvenience (counting yams) than the major tragedy (being sold).
4. Both similar phrases help establish that the proverb is about someone who misses the fundamental problem while focusing on a trivial consequence.

Interim Insight: These proverbs use dramatic irony to highlight how people sometimes focus on minor inconveniences while ignoring catastrophic situations affecting them.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The person who is sold and the money is used to buy a machete: he says the machete is causing him suffering.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb uses irony to criticize people who miss the main issue while complaining about a minor consequence. The person in the proverb has been sold into slavery (a catastrophic life event), yet is concerned about the suffering caused by the machete that was purchased with the money from their sale. The proverb teaches about proper perspective and priorities - warning against focusing on trivial matters while ignoring the fundamental problems. In Yoruba wisdom tradition, this reflects the importance of clear thinking and proper assessment of one's situation. It can be applied to situations where people misidentify the true source of their problems or fail to recognize the gravity of their circumstances.

- References: The pattern is consistent across all three examples - someone is sold, the money buys something (machete/lamp/yams), and then the person complains about a minor issue related to that item rather than the fact they were sold into slavery.

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""Ẹni à bá tà ká fowó-o rẹ̀ ra àdá: ó ní ìyà àdá ńjẹ òun"" translates to ""The person who is sold and the money is used to buy a machete: he says the machete is causing him suffering."" It criticizes the human tendency to focus on minor inconveniences while ignoring major calamities. The profound irony in the proverb serves as a teaching tool about maintaining proper perspective in life and correctly identifying the true source of one's problems."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Kàkà kí àgbò ké, àgbò a kú"" translates to ""Rather than for the ram to bleat, the ram would die.""
2. This suggests a theme of maintaining dignity or pride even in difficult situations - the ram would rather die than make a sound showing weakness.
3. The imagery conveys choosing a difficult but dignified option over one that might be easier but humiliating.
4. This helps me understand the original proverb likely contrasts two choices: submission to someone (prostrating to the Gambari/Hausa person) versus maintaining dignity even at great cost.

Interim Insight: The proverb appears to be about choosing death with dignity over living with humiliation or submission.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""Rather than prostrate (bow down) for a Hausa man (Gambari), it's better to endure and die.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ká ríni sọ̀rọ̀ fúnni ò dàbí-i ká sọ̀rọ̀ fúnni ká gbà"" translates to ""Having someone to speak to is not the same as having someone who listens and accepts what you say.""
2. This proverb emphasizes the distinction between superficial interaction and genuine understanding or respect.
3. In relation to the original proverb, it suggests there's a cultural context about relationships between different ethnic groups (Yoruba and Hausa) where true respect might be lacking.
4. It adds a layer about dignity and being acknowledged properly versus merely going through motions of respect without genuine reciprocity.

Interim Insight: The original proverb likely refers to maintaining one's cultural dignity rather than submitting to someone who may not truly respect you or your culture.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""Rather than prostrate before a Hausa man (in humiliation), it is better to face hardship and die with dignity.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb reflects the historical ethnic tensions between Yoruba and Hausa peoples in Nigeria. In Yoruba culture, prostrating is a sign of respect, but the proverb suggests that maintaining one's dignity and cultural integrity is more important than submitting to someone who may not reciprocate that respect. It speaks to the importance of honor and self-respect in Yoruba culture, suggesting that death with dignity is preferable to life with humiliation. The proverb teaches that one should not compromise fundamental values and personal dignity even in challenging circumstances.

- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of dignity before submission, while Similar Phrase 2 highlights the importance of genuine respect rather than superficial acknowledgment in interpersonal relationships."

2. It conveys wisdom about knowing when to detach from situations, suggesting that sometimes neither involvement nor expectation is the wisest course.

Interim Insight: This phrase reinforces the idea that knowing when to engage or disengage is crucial in Yoruba wisdom. Combined with our main proverb, it suggests that persistent engagement in dangerous situations leads to negative consequences.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""Refusing to leave kills the mosquito; refusing to leave kills the bush rat; refusing to leave kills the wildcat.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb teaches about the dangers of staying too long in harmful situations or contexts. It uses a progression of increasingly powerful animals (mosquito, bush rat, wildcat) to show that persistence in danger is perilous regardless of one's strength or status. The wisdom conveyed is that knowing when to retreat or disengage is crucial for survival. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would be used to advise against stubbornness, overstaying one's welcome, or persisting in situations that have become dangerous or unproductive.

- References: The similar phrases reinforce the Yoruba cultural emphasis on moderation, appropriate timing, and strategic disengagement. Like the main proverb, they speak to the wisdom of knowing boundaries and limits.

2. This phrase uses the structure ""X ńṣe bí Y"" (X behaves/pretends to be Y), where X is something smaller or less significant trying to imitate Y, which is greater or more significant.
3. This suggests our proverb follows a similar pattern of comparing things that may look alike but have different values or significance.

Interim Insight: The proverb likely deals with false appearances or imitation, where something of lesser value is mimicking or being compared to something of greater value.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""Ṣàkì (a type of cloth) behaves like ọ̀rá (velvet), egungun (bones/masquerade) behaves like ẹran (meat/flesh).""

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""Ṣàkì (cloth) pretends to be velvet, bones pretend to be meat.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against false appearances and pretense. Just as common cloth cannot truly be luxurious velvet, and dry bones cannot be succulent meat, people should not pretend to be what they are not. In Yoruba culture, authenticity is highly valued, and this proverb cautions against deception and false pretenses. It reminds people to recognize the true nature of things and not be fooled by outward appearances. The proverb could be applied to situations where someone or something is pretending to have qualities or value they do not actually possess.

Similar Phrase 2: Àgbà-ìyà tí ńmùkọ ọ̀níní, ó ní nítorí omi gbígbóná orí-i rẹ̀ ni.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This second phrase translates roughly as ""The elderly person drinking hot soup says it's because of the hot water that has passed over their head."" This refers to someone who has experienced difficulties before and thus can handle current challenges.
2. This connects to the main proverb by referencing experience, patience, and consequences. The household head (baálé) who rushes may lack the wisdom that comes from experience.
3. Both phrases emphasize cause and effect relationships in behavior and the wisdom that comes from understanding these connections.

Interim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the importance of patience and experience in leadership, suggesting that the hasty household head encounters trouble precisely because they lack the wisdom to proceed carefully.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The hastiness of the household head is what leads to encountering misfortune on the journey.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against impulsive leadership and hasty decision-making. In Yoruba culture, the household head (baálé) holds significant authority and responsibility. When such a person acts rashly without proper deliberation, they not only endanger themselves but also those under their authority. The proverb teaches that patience, thoughtful consideration, and proper timing are essential qualities of effective leadership. Just as creatures belong in their natural habitats (as in the first supporting phrase), and just as experience breeds wisdom (as in the second phrase), leaders must exercise patience and good judgment to avoid unnecessary troubles.

- References: The crab belongs in the forest, not the savanna; The elder who drinks hot soup has experienced hotter water before.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Ọ̀yájú-u baálé ní ńpàdé ìbòsí lọ́nà"" means ""The hastiness of the household head leads to encountering misfortune on the journey."" This Yoruba wisdom cautions against impulsive leadership, teaching that when those in authority act rashly without proper consideration, they invite trouble. In Yoruba culture, the household head's decisions affect the entire family, making patience and careful deliberation essential virtues for anyone in a position of authority. The proverb reminds leaders that haste often leads to regrettable consequences that could have been avoided with proper patience and foresight."

Similar Phrase 1: ""Bí ojú kò bá ti olè, a ti ará ilé ẹ̀."" (If the thief is not ashamed, the family members will be ashamed.)

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This similar phrase speaks about shame and consequences of behavior affecting not just the individual but their community.
2. It suggests a social responsibility where one's actions reflect on others and have wider consequences.
3. The phrase emphasizes how ignoring social norms leads to negative outcomes.
4. There's an element of hierarchy and respect implied - when expected behaviors aren't followed, social disorder results.

Interim Insight: This phrase indicates that the main proverb likely deals with proper social conduct, especially regarding respect for established social hierarchies and the consequences of failing to observe them.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""An elder who refuses to greet the king is tying a rope around himself."" (Or more directly: ""An elder who doesn't greet the Aare is using a rope to bury himself."")

## Step 3 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 2: ""Ọ̀kánjúwà àgbà ní ńsọ ara ẹ̀ dèwe."" (It is a stubborn elder who reduces himself to the status of a child.)

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This phrase discusses how an elder's inappropriate behavior can diminish their own status.
2. It points to the Yoruba concept that wisdom and proper conduct are expected to increase with age.
3. When elders act inappropriately, they undermine their own position in society.
4. This relates strongly to the main proverb - both involve elders failing to act according to their status.

Interim Insight: This second phrase clarifies that the main proverb is specifically about how elders who don't observe proper protocols (like greeting authority figures) are actively harming their own standing and bringing consequences upon themselves.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""An elder who refuses to greet the king is preparing for his own funeral.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb teaches about the importance of showing proper respect to authority figures in Yoruba culture. The ""Aare"" is a title for a high chief or king, and greeting elders and authority figures is a fundamental aspect of Yoruba social etiquette. When an elder refuses to show this basic respect, they are metaphorically preparing for their own demise - both socially and potentially literally. The proverb highlights how pride and refusal to acknowledge established hierarchies leads to self-destruction. In Yoruba society, such behavior would lead to social isolation and loss of status, effectively a form of social death.

- References: The first similar phrase demonstrates how improper behavior brings shame, while the second clarifies how elders are especially expected to model proper conduct, and failure to do so diminishes their status to that of immature individuals.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Àgbàlagbà tí ò kí Ààrẹ ńfi okùn sin ara-a rẹ̀"" translates to ""An elder who refuses to greet the king is preparing for his own funeral."" It emphasizes that refusing to show proper respect to authority figures, especially when you yourself hold elevated status as an elder, is self-destructive. In Yoruba culture, this represents a serious breach of social norms that would result in loss of status and social standing - a metaphorical death within the community."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ibi tí a ti mú ọ̀lẹ ò kúnná; ibi tí a ti mú alágbáraá tó oko-ó ro"" translates to ""Where a lazy person is caught, there's no fire; where a strong person is caught, it's enough to till a farm.""
2. This phrase contrasts the capabilities of a lazy person versus a strong, energetic person, showing how energy and strength determine what can be accomplished.
3. The contrast suggests that having strength/energy (ápá) is crucial for productivity, just as our main proverb mentions ""ápá"" (strength/arm).

Interim Insight: Both phrases emphasize how physical capability and energy determine productivity. The similar phrase suggests that when someone has strength, they can accomplish significant tasks, while laziness results in minimal output.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""It is lack of strength that makes the machete not cut; if we have strength, a cotton plant is enough to cut a tree.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Bí baálẹ̀-ẹ́ bá ńtàkìtì, òrógi là ḿbá ẹmẹsẹ̀"" translates to ""If the head of the house is stomping/dancing vigorously, we use a tree trunk to respond to the rhythm.""
2. This proverb suggests that when a leader shows energy and enthusiasm, followers respond with even greater effort or commitment.
3. It reinforces the idea that energy and strength (as in the main proverb) influence outcomes and determine what can be accomplished.

Interim Insight: This second phrase adds the cultural value of energy begetting energy, and how determination can overcome apparent limitations. It's not just about physical strength but also about enthusiasm and commitment to a task.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""It is lack of strength that makes the machete not cut; if we have strength, even a cotton plant is enough to cut a tree.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that limitations often come from lack of effort or determination rather than external circumstances. Just as a machete fails to cut not because it's blunt but because the wielder lacks strength, our failures may result from insufficient effort. The cotton plant (soft) cutting a tree (hard) is a powerful metaphor showing that with sufficient determination and energy, even seemingly inadequate tools can accomplish difficult tasks. The proverb emphasizes the Yoruba cultural value of diligence, perseverance, and the belief that human will and effort can overcome apparent limitations.

- References: Both similar phrases reinforce this interpretation by contrasting productivity with energy levels and showing how determination can transcend apparent limitations, reflecting the Yoruba emphasis on diligence and personal agency in achieving success.

Final Answer:
The proverb ""Àì-lápá làdá ò mú; bí a bá lápá, ọmọ owú to-o gégi"" translates to ""It is lack of strength that makes the machete not cut; if we have strength, even a cotton plant is enough to cut a tree."" This proverb teaches that our limitations often stem from insufficient effort rather than external circumstances. In Yoruba culture, it emphasizes that with enough determination and energy, seemingly impossible tasks become achievable—even using apparently inadequate tools (like cutting a tree with a soft cotton plant). This reflects the cultural values of diligence, perseverance, and the belief in human agency to overcome obstacles through sustained effort and determination."

Similar Phrase 1: Bí ọmọdé bá fẹ́ ṣìṣe àgbà, ọjọ́ orí-i rẹ̀ ò níí jẹ́.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase translates to ""If a child wants to behave like an elder, his age won't permit it"" - suggesting natural limitations based on one's position
2. This speaks to the Yoruba understanding of hierarchy and proper positioning in society - everyone has their place
3. The structure ""Bí...bá fẹ́..."" (If...wants to...) appears in both proverbs, suggesting a parallel about inappropriate desires or attempts to overstep boundaries

Interim Insight: The main proverb likely concerns someone of lower status (ìlàrí - a palace attendant/servant) attempting something beyond their station, similar to how the child in the similar phrase attempts to act above their age/position.

Chain-of-Thought:
1. This phrase translates to ""If God hasn't made someone a father, one strives to act like an elder"" - showing how people might try to compensate for their positions
2. It suggests that despite predetermined social positions, people attempt to elevate themselves through effort or rebellion
3. The concept of divine or natural order appears in both - in the similar phrase, it's God's determination; in the main proverb, it's the established political hierarchy

Interim Insight: The main proverb explores power dynamics and potential rebellion, questioning what authority (the king) can do when subordinates (palace attendants) challenge the established order.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""If a palace servant decides to rebel, people ask, 'What can the king do about it?'""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb reflects on the vulnerability of authority when faced with rebellion from those meant to serve it. It suggests that even kings have limitations to their power if those under them collectively decide to revolt. The proverb serves as both a warning about the fragility of power and a reflection on the responsibility of leadership. In Yoruba culture, which traditionally respected hierarchical authority but also valued collective action, this proverb captures the tension between established order and the potential for upheaval when subordinates reject their position.
- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of social positioning and limitations based on one's station. Similar Phrase 2 highlights how people attempt to transcend their designated roles through effort or rebellion, adding complexity to the power dynamics expressed in the main proverb.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Bí ìlàrí bá fẹ́ tẹ́, a ní kí lọba ó ṣe?"" translates to ""If a palace servant decides to rebel, people ask, 'What can the king do about it?'"" It speaks to the limitations of authority when faced with rebellion from subordinates. In Yoruba political philosophy, this proverb acknowledges that even the most powerful ruler depends on the cooperation of those beneath them, and when that social contract breaks down, traditional power structures can be threatened. The proverb serves as a reminder that legitimate leadership requires not just formal authority but also the continued consent of followers."

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""Except for what is not sold in the market, a slave does not eat.""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to social boundaries and status limitations in traditional society. It means that people of lower status (symbolized by slaves) should not have access to rare or forbidden items that even free people cannot obtain. More broadly, it teaches that everyone, regardless of position, must respect certain boundaries and limitations. In modern context, it reminds us that there are universal limitations that apply to everyone, and no one should expect special privileges beyond what is naturally available to all.
- References: Both similar phrases reinforce concepts of social boundaries, proper behavior within one's station, and the natural limitations that govern all members of society regardless of status.

Final Answer:
The proverb ""Àfi ohun tí a kì í tà lọ́jà lẹrú kì í jẹ"" translates to ""Except for what is not sold in the market, a slave does not eat."" This Yoruba wisdom teaches about social boundaries and universal limitations. It means that even those of lower status shouldn't expect access to things unavailable to everyone else. The proverb establishes that certain limitations apply universally - if something is so rare or forbidden that it's not even available in the marketplace for free people, then those of lower status certainly shouldn't expect access to it. In contemporary application, it reminds us that there are natural boundaries in life that apply to everyone, and we shouldn't expect special exceptions beyond what is reasonably available to all."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Àlejò kì í lọ kó mú onílé dání"" translates to ""A visitor doesn't leave and then put the host to shame.""

3. The structure follows a similar pattern to our proverb, using ""kì í"" (does not) and ""dání"" (put to shame).
4. Both proverbs appear to be about maintaining proper order in relationships.

Interim Insight: The proverb likely deals with proper roles and boundaries, where one entity should not overstep its position to embarrass or disadvantage another.

2. This proverb speaks to cause and effect, particularly related to authority figures and their influence on others' behavior.
3. It suggests that people in power create the conditions for others' reactions.
4. This helps us understand our main proverb: the hawk (powerful predator) creates conditions that affect the chicken's behavior.

Interim Insight: The proverb appears to be about power dynamics, where the powerful (hawk) should not create situations that lead to embarrassment by enabling lesser beings (chickens) to act beyond their station.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""A hawk does not swoop down merely for a chicken to catch insects and put someone to shame.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to proper social order and hierarchy. The hawk is a powerful predator while the chicken is prey. The natural order is for hawks to hunt chickens, not to help them catch insects. The proverb teaches that those in positions of power should not diminish themselves to elevate those beneath them in ways that disrupt social harmony. It warns against inverting natural hierarchies or enabling those of lower status to embarrass or challenge those above them. The wisdom reminds us that each person has their proper role in society, and attempting to reverse these roles leads to disorder and shame.

- References: The interpretation draws from both ""Àlejò kì í lọ kó mú onílé dání"" (a visitor shouldn't shame their host) and ""Bí àgbà kò bá ṣe ohun ẹ̀rù, ọmọdé kì í sá"" (elders' actions determine children's reactions), highlighting Yoruba cultural values around social order, respect for hierarchy, and proper conduct between those of different statuses."

Similar Phrase 1: Aaka ò gbé ọ̀dàn; igbó ní ńgbé.
(The vine does not support the savanna; it's the forest that supports it.)

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This similar phrase speaks to natural order and appropriate environments - each thing has its place and context where it thrives.
2. It suggests that elements work properly in their rightful place, implying that proper function depends on accepting one's natural role or position.
3. The imagery contrasts the savanna (open space) with the forest (structured ecosystem) - suggesting ordered systems versus chaos.

Interim Insight: This phrase establishes a context of natural order and the importance of accepting the proper nature of things rather than rejecting established wisdom.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""One may speak of inheritance, one may speak of wisdom, but 'I don't want it, I won't accept it' is how a fool ends a matter.""

Similar Phrase 2: Kí ni orí ńṣe tí èjìká ò lè ṣe? Èjìká ru ẹrù ó gba ọ̀ọ́dúnrún; orí ta tiẹ̀ ní ogúnlúgba.
(What can the head do that the shoulders cannot? The shoulders carry loads worth five hundred cowries; the head sells its own for just twenty.)

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This phrase contrasts the head (representing thinking/wisdom) with shoulders (representing physical strength/labor).
2. It suggests that wisdom (the head) is actually more valuable than mere physical capability, despite appearances.
3. The numerical values (500 vs. 20) create irony - what seems more capable (shoulders) is actually less valuable than wisdom (the head).

Interim Insight: This adds the dimension that rejecting wisdom (as in the main proverb) is foolish because wisdom is ultimately more valuable than stubborn resistance or physical strength.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""One may offer inheritance, one may offer wisdom, but 'I don't want it, I won't accept it' is how a fool ends a matter.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb criticizes the foolishness of rejecting advice, wisdom, or beneficial legacies out of stubbornness or pride. In Yoruba culture, wisdom (ọgbọn) and inheritance/tradition (ogún) are valued resources that contribute to success and well-being. The proverb teaches that only a fool would summarily dismiss these valuable resources without consideration. Just as the vine needs the forest (Similar Phrase 1), people need to accept and work within established wisdom. And just as the head's wisdom exceeds the shoulders' strength in value (Similar Phrase 2), accepting guidance and inheritance brings greater benefit than stubborn rejection. The proverb ultimately cautions against the pride and close-mindedness that leads people to reject beneficial counsel.

- References: The interpretation draws on the ecological harmony referenced in Similar Phrase 1 and the value hierarchy established in Similar Phrase 2 to explain why rejecting wisdom and inheritance is considered foolish in Yoruba thought."

## Step 0 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 1: Ẹni tí a ò fẹ́, àlọ́ ò kàn án.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ẹni tí a ò fẹ́, àlọ́ ò kàn án"" translates roughly to ""The person who is not loved/wanted is not involved in the discussion/conversation.""
2. This suggests a cultural context where social inclusion or exclusion is based on affection or preference.
3. It indicates that in Yoruba culture, those who are not favored might be excluded from important conversations or decisions.
4. This similar phrase emphasizes the consequences of not being the preferred person in a situation.

Interim Insight: There appears to be a cultural theme about differential treatment based on preference or favor, where being the favored one grants privileges and inclusion.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""The person that we love/want is different from the person who says there is no one like him/her.""

## Step 3 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 2: Ẹni tí a ò fẹ́ nílùú kì í jó lójú agbo.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ẹni tí a ò fẹ́ nílùú kì í jó lójú agbo"" translates to ""The person who is not wanted/loved in town does not dance in the public square.""
2. This proverb reinforces the idea that those who aren't favored by the community don't get to showcase themselves publicly.
3. It adds the dimension of public performance and recognition being tied to social acceptance.
4. There's an implication of community consensus about who is valued and who isn't.

Interim Insight: The cultural context emphasizes how community perception determines someone's opportunities for expression and recognition. Self-assessment differs from how others perceive and value you.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The person we love is different from the person who claims there is no one like them.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the disconnect between self-perception and external validation. It suggests that people who boast about their uniqueness or superiority (""there is no one like me"") may not actually be the ones who are truly valued or loved by others. In Yoruba culture, community opinion often matters more than self-assessment. The proverb serves as a humbling reminder that our own high opinion of ourselves doesn't necessarily align with how others see us. It cautions against arrogance and self-importance, emphasizing that genuine affection and respect from others is more meaningful than self-proclaimed greatness.

- References: The similar phrases reinforce this interpretation by showing how those who aren't favored by the community face exclusion (Similar Phrase 1) and aren't given platforms for public expression (Similar Phrase 2), regardless of their self-perception.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Ẹni tí a fẹ́ yàtọ̀ sí ẹni tó ní kò sí irú òun"" translates to ""The person we love is different from the person who claims there is no one like them."" It reveals the Yoruba cultural wisdom about the gap between self-importance and actual community valuation. It warns that those who boast about their uniqueness may not be the ones truly valued by the community. This reflects the Yoruba emphasis on humility and the importance of community validation over self-aggrandizement. The proverb serves as a reminder that how others perceive us often matters more than our perception of ourselves in traditional Yoruba social contexts."
CG-CoT,Anthropic,Àgùnbánirọ̀ ní ńfojúdini.,It is the person taller than another who shows no respect for the other.,"# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb ""Àgùnbánirọ̀ ní ńfojúdini.""

## Step 0 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 1: Àkíìjẹ́ mú òrìṣà níyì.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Àkíìjẹ́ mú òrìṣà níyì"" translates to ""Not being consumed is what gives a deity its reverence/respect."" This Yoruba proverb suggests that distance or inaccessibility creates respect and mystique.
2. This relates to how sacred things maintain their power by being set apart or not overly familiar.
3. The phrase teaches about boundaries and respect in relationships, especially with authority figures or sacred entities.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests a cultural value that maintains respect requires some level of distance or boundary. This may inform our understanding of ""Àgùnbánirọ̀ ní ńfojúdini"" as potentially dealing with relationships, boundaries, or respect.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""A person who climbs onto another's back is the one who sees ahead."" (Àgùnbá = one who climbs on back, nirọ̀ = on another, ní = is, ńfojúdini = sees ahead)

## Step 3 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 2: Ìpéǹpéjú ò ní enini; àgbàlagbà irùngbọ̀n ò ṣe òlòó.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ìpéǹpéjú ò ní enini; àgbàlagbà irùngbọ̀n ò ṣe òlòó"" translates to ""A brief moment doesn't have depth; an elder with a gray beard isn't automatically wise."" 
2. This proverb cautions against superficial judgments or assumptions based merely on appearances or status.
3. It emphasizes that true wisdom or understanding comes from more than just external markers or position.

Interim Insight: This second phrase adds the cultural nuance that position alone (like being an elder) doesn't guarantee wisdom. Similarly, in our target proverb, the person who climbs on another's back gains perspective not through their own merit but through their position relative to others.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The person who rides on another's back is the one who sees farther.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the advantages gained through relationships with others. It acknowledges that people achieve greater vision or perspective not solely through their own abilities but by ""standing on the shoulders"" of others. However, when paired with the context phrases, there's a deeper meaning: while those who leverage others may see farther, this position doesn't necessarily confer real wisdom or respect. The proverb can be used to comment on people who achieve visibility or advantage through others rather than their own merit. It serves as both an acknowledgment of interdependence in society and a subtle critique of those who use others for personal advancement.

- References: The interpretation is informed by ""Àkíìjẹ́ mú òrìṣà níyì"" (respect requires distance) and ""Ìpéǹpéjú ò ní enini; àgbàlagbà irùngbọ̀n ò ṣe òlòó"" (position alone doesn't guarantee wisdom)."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1

Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Ẹ̀wọ̀n tó tó ọ̀pẹ ò tó-ó dá erin dúró; ìtàkùn tó ní kí erin má ròkè ọ̀dàn, tòun terin ní ńlọ"" uses similar imagery of restraints (ẹ̀wọ̀n/chains) that are as tall as a palm tree but still insufficient to stop an elephant.
2. Both proverbs mention ""ìtàkùn"" (rope or vine) and ""erin"" (elephant), establishing a contrast between something seemingly strong (a tall rope) and something much stronger (an elephant).
3. The similar phrase adds the imagery of ""ọ̀dàn"" (savannah) which suggests an elephant's natural habitat and movement.

Interim Insight: This proverb appears to use the contrast between a rope's height and an elephant's strength to illustrate the futility of weak restrictions against determined forces. The repeated structure emphasizes that attempting to restrain something beyond your capacity leads to you being dragged along with it.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation

Translation: ""A rope as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant from going; the rope that says an elephant should not go to Alo, will go along with the elephant.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2

Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ọkùnrin kì í ké, akọ igi kì í ṣoje"" translates to ""A man does not cry, a male tree does not produce sap."" This proverb speaks to expected behaviors based on inherent nature.
2. This adds cultural context about Yoruba perceptions of natural order and inherent qualities - just as a male tree naturally doesn't produce sap, certain outcomes are predetermined by nature.
3. When paired with our main proverb, it suggests that attempting to prevent what is natural or inevitable (like an elephant's movement) is futile - one cannot change the fundamental nature of things.

Interim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces the idea that trying to prevent something from expressing its natural strength or tendency is futile. The elephant will go where it wants to go because that is its nature, just as a male tree doesn't produce sap.

## Final Synthesis:

- Final Translation: ""A rope as tall as a palm tree cannot prevent an elephant from going; the rope that insists an elephant should not go to Alo will end up going along with the elephant.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches about the futility of attempting to restrain forces beyond one's control. In Yoruba culture, the elephant symbolizes great power and unstoppable determination. The palm tree, though tall and significant, represents inadequate restraint. The proverb warns against trying to control what is beyond your capacity, as you may find yourself dragged along instead. It counsels wisdom in recognizing limitations and respecting natural order. The proverb could apply to interpersonal relationships, governance, or any situation where one might overestimate their ability to control powerful forces or determined individuals.

- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the contrast between attempted restraint (rope/chains) and unstoppable force (elephant). Similar Phrase 2 adds cultural context about natural order and the futility of opposing inherent qualities or tendencies."

Similar Phrase 1: Bí a kò bá tó baba ọmọọ́ ṣe, a kì í pe alákàrà.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Bí a kò bá tó baba ọmọọ́ ṣe, a kì í pe alákàrà"" translates to ""If you can't reach the child's father, you don't call the bean cake seller."" This suggests proper order or protocol in Yoruba culture.
2. This phrase emphasizes the importance of doing things in the right order or following the proper hierarchy, which may relate to our target proverb's meaning.
3. The similar phrase warns against skipping steps or bypassing authority figures, suggesting a cultural value of respecting proper procedures.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that the target proverb may also be about proper sequence, procedures, or focusing on the primary task before moving to secondary concerns.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""If one is pounding yam, the feet should not be sticking out."" or ""When pounding yam, one's foot shouldn't be protruding.""

## Step 3 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 2: Bí a bá dàgbà à yé ogun-ún jà.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This second similar phrase translates to ""When one grows old, one understands how to fight battles"" or ""With age comes wisdom about which battles to fight.""
2. This suggests learning from experience and gaining wisdom about proper approaches to challenges.
3. This relates to our target proverb by reinforcing the importance of proper technique and focus - just as the elderly know which battles to choose, one should know how to properly pound yam (keeping feet tucked in for safety and proper form).
4. In both phrases, there's a lesson about proper execution of tasks based on knowledge and attention.

Interim Insight: The proverb is likely advising complete concentration and proper technique when performing important tasks, similar to how experience teaches one to approach challenges correctly.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""When pounding yam, one's feet should not be sticking out.""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb uses the common household activity of pounding yam (a staple food) to teach a broader lesson about focus and proper procedure. Pounding yam requires concentration and proper form - if one's feet are sticking out, it indicates improper technique and risk of injury. The proverb advises that when undertaking any important task, one should be fully committed, follow proper procedures, and avoid distractions or carelessness. It teaches the value of doing things properly and with full attention rather than haphazardly or with divided focus. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the emphasis on thoroughness and proper execution of tasks.
- References: Both similar phrases reinforce the cultural importance of proper order (Similar Phrase 1) and the wisdom of correct approaches to tasks (Similar Phrase 2).

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""Bí a bá ńgúnyán, kòmẹsẹ̀ á yọ"" translates to ""When pounding yam, one's feet should not be sticking out."" It uses the culturally significant activity of food preparation to teach about proper focus and technique. In Yoruba society, pounding yam is done in a mortar while sitting on a low stool - if one's feet are sticking out, it shows poor form and creates risk. The proverb advises complete concentration on important tasks, proper execution, and avoiding divided attention. It embodies the Yoruba cultural value of thoroughness and careful attention to process in all endeavors."
CG-CoT,Anthropic,Ọmọ àì-jọbẹ̀-rí tí ńja epo sáyà.,A child new to eating stews: he shows himself by dripping palm-oil on his chest.,"# Translation and Interpretation of Yoruba Proverb

## Step 0 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 1: ""Ọ̀ràn ò dun ọmọ ẹṣin; a mú ìyá ẹ̀ so, ó ńjẹ oko kiri.""
(The foal is unconcerned; its mother is tied up while it grazes freely around.)

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This similar phrase speaks about a young foal that doesn't understand consequences - while its mother is restrained, it roams freely eating grass.
2. There's a theme of youthful ignorance or inexperience - the foal doesn't recognize that its freedom depends on its mother's restriction.
3. The phrase suggests a generational disconnect where the young doesn't appreciate the sacrifices or limitations of parents/elders.

Interim Insight: Both proverbs likely deal with inexperience, particularly of youth, and how this leads to inappropriate or unsustainable behavior that doesn't recognize consequences or proper social order.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""A child who has never seen soup (preparation) that splashes palm oil on their chest.""

## Step 3 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 2: ""Ajá rí epo kò lá; ìyá-a rẹ̀ẹ́ ṣu ihá bí.""
(A dog sees palm oil but doesn't lick it; its mother gave birth to a fool.)

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This phrase refers to palm oil (epo), which is also mentioned in our main proverb.
2. In Yoruba culture, palm oil is valuable - a dog that doesn't lick it is considered foolish or unusual.
3. The phrase suggests that proper behavior toward valuable things is expected and natural - going against this natural inclination indicates something is wrong.
4. Both phrases involve relationships with palm oil that reveal character or experience.

Interim Insight: The main proverb likely refers to someone inexperienced who mishandles or wastes valuable resources (palm oil) due to ignorance, while experienced people would know better.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""A child who has never witnessed soup preparation splashes palm oil on their chest.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb criticizes someone who mishandles valuable resources due to inexperience. In Yoruba culture, palm oil is precious and used carefully in cooking. Someone who has never seen soup prepared properly might carelessly splash the oil on themselves rather than in the pot. This represents inexperienced people who waste resources, make mistakes, or act inappropriately because they lack proper training or understanding. It's a commentary on how proper knowledge comes from observation and experience, and those without it often make wasteful or foolish decisions.

- References: The first similar phrase shows how youth often don't understand consequences of their actions, while the second emphasizes how proper treatment of valuable resources (like palm oil) is expected from those with sense and proper upbringing.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Ọmọ àì-jọbẹ̀-rí tí ńja epo sáyà"" means ""A child who has never witnessed soup preparation splashes palm oil on their chest."" It teaches that inexperience leads to waste and improper behavior. Just as someone unfamiliar with cooking might carelessly waste precious palm oil by splashing it on themselves rather than using it properly in food, people without proper knowledge or training often misuse resources or act inappropriately. The proverb emphasizes the importance of learning through observation and experience before handling valuable resources or responsibilities."
CG-CoT,Anthropic,Kì í dọwọ́-ọ baba kó ló di ọwọ́ ọmọ.,Responsibility does not devolve on the father only for him to say it is his son's duty.,"# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb ""Kì í dọwọ́-ọ baba kó ló di ọwọ́ ọmọ.""

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Bí Ọya ńkọ lọ́run, bí Ṣàngó ńjó láyé, kò níí burú fún baba kó ní ó dọwọ́ ọmọ òun lọ́run"" references Yoruba deities Ọya and Ṣàngó in relation to a father and child.
2. It suggests that no matter what calamities occur (symbolized by Ọya sewing in heaven and Ṣàngó dancing on earth), a father would not wish misfortune upon his child.
3. This indicates a profound parent-child relationship in Yoruba culture where a parent prioritizes their child's welfare above all.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely concerns the protective relationship between parents and children, particularly emphasizing that troubles affecting a father should not transfer to his children.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""It should not move from father's hand to say it has become the child's hand/responsibility.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""A ò mọ ohun tí Dárò-ó ní kó tó wí pé olè-é kó òun"" translates to ""We don't know what Daro had before claiming that a thief stole from him.""
2. This phrase suggests caution about blaming others when we might not have had anything to begin with.
3. In relation to our proverb, it hints at the idea of responsibility and accountability - not transferring one's problems or failures to others, including one's children.

Interim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the notion that our proverb addresses inappropriate transfer of burdens or responsibilities, suggesting that parents should not shift their problems to their children.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""A father's burden should not become his child's responsibility.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the ethical principle that parents should bear their own responsibilities and not transfer their burdens, problems, or obligations to their children. In Yoruba culture, while children are expected to respect and support their parents, parents have a primary duty to protect their children from unnecessary hardship. The proverb cautions against parents who might use their children as scapegoats or burden them with problems that rightfully belong to the parents. It reflects the Yoruba value of appropriate responsibility-bearing across generations and the protection of the younger generation from the mistakes or difficulties of their elders.

- References: The similar phrases reinforce how deeply the Yoruba culture values proper intergenerational relationships and the protection of children from undue burdens, even when faced with significant challenges (as with Ọya and Ṣàngó) or the temptation to displace blame (as in the Daro example).

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""Kì í dọwọ́-ọ baba kó ló di ọwọ́ ọmọ"" translates to ""A father's burden should not become his child's responsibility."" It emphasizes that parents should not transfer their problems, failures, or obligations to their children. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of appropriate responsibility across generations and the ethical principle that elders should protect younger ones from unnecessary hardship rather than using them as outlets for their own difficulties."

## Step 0 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 1: Ó yẹ ẹni gbogbo kó sọ pé iṣu ò jiná, kò yẹ alubàtá.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This similar phrase follows the same structure: ""It is fitting for everyone to say [something], but not fitting for [specific person].""
2. In this phrase, ""iṣu ò jiná"" means ""yam is not hot/burning"" and ""alubàtá"" refers to a drummer who plays the talking drum.
3. The phrase suggests that while everyone can comment on the temperature of yams, it would be inappropriate for a drummer to do so, as they should be focused on their craft.
4. This establishes a pattern where the proverb contrasts general behavior with specialized responsibility.

Interim Insight: The structure suggests our target proverb likely contrasts general communal behavior with the specialized responsibility of a particular role or person.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""It is fitting for everyone to reduce the cost of indigo dye, but not fitting for the dyer.""

## Step 3 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 2: Ó yẹ ẹni gbogbo kó sọ pé ""Ọlọ́run a-ṣèkan-má-kù,"" kò yẹ akúkó.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This second similar phrase maintains the same structure but with different content.
2. ""Ọlọ́run a-ṣèkan-má-kù"" is a praise name for God meaning ""God who does things once and perfectly.""
3. ""Akúkó"" refers to a rooster, which crows repeatedly, contrasting with the once-and-perfect nature attributed to God.
4. This reinforces the idea that these proverbs highlight contradictions between general statements and specific roles or characteristics.

Interim Insight: The pattern confirms that the target proverb is about how certain actions or statements may be acceptable from the general public but inappropriate from specialists whose livelihood depends on the very thing being discussed.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""It is fitting for everyone to advocate for lower prices of indigo dye, but not fitting for the dyer (whose livelihood depends on it).""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the conflict between community interests and individual professional interests. While the general public may reasonably want lower prices for goods like indigo dye, it would be self-defeating for the dyer (atọ̀ọ́lé) to advocate for the same, as their livelihood depends on fair compensation for their specialized work. The proverb teaches about the importance of recognizing different perspectives based on one's position and role in society. It warns against expecting people to act against their own legitimate interests, while acknowledging that community and individual needs may sometimes be in tension.

- References: Similar Phrase 1 (about yams and drummers) and Similar Phrase 2 (about God's perfection and roosters) both follow the same pattern of contrasting general statements with specialized roles, reinforcing the interpretation of conflicting perspectives based on one's position in society.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Ó yẹ ẹni gbogbo kó dínwó aró, kò yẹ atọ̀ọ́lé"" translates to ""It is fitting for everyone to advocate for lower prices of indigo dye, but not fitting for the dyer."" This Yoruba wisdom highlights how perspectives and appropriate behaviors differ based on one's role in society. While consumers naturally want lower prices, a craftsperson cannot reasonably devalue their own work and products. The proverb teaches respect for specialized knowledge and legitimate self-interest, while acknowledging the natural tension between community desires and professional sustainability."

Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Kò sí mi lájọ àjọ ò kún: ara ẹ̀ ló tàn jẹ"" translates to ""My absence didn't make the gathering incomplete; one only deceives oneself.""
2. This phrase highlights self-deception and the reality that no one is indispensable.
3. It suggests a theme of consequence and personal responsibility that may relate to our target proverb.
4. Both phrases seem to address misconceptions about one's impact or circumstances.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that the target proverb may deal with self-perception, consequences of actions, or the temporary nature of situations.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""The spoilage/misfortune of one day does not finish easily/quickly.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Aláṣọ-kan kì í ṣeré òjò"" translates to ""A person with only one garment doesn't play in the rain.""
2. This phrase warns about risk management and preparedness - if you have limited resources, you should be cautious.
3. It suggests consequences can last longer than the initial action (getting wet in rain means having no dry clothes afterward).
4. This connects to our target proverb about how consequences of bad events can extend far beyond the original incident.

Interim Insight: The second phrase reinforces that our proverb is about how the effects of misfortune can linger long after the initial event, emphasizing prudence and foresight.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The misfortune of a single day doesn't end quickly.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that the consequences of a single unfortunate event or bad decision can extend far beyond the day it occurs. It warns against impulsive actions by emphasizing that momentary troubles can create lasting effects. In Yoruba culture, which values foresight and wisdom, this proverb serves as a reminder to think about the long-term implications of one's choices. It encourages prudence and careful consideration, recognizing that recovery from setbacks often takes much longer than the events that caused them.

- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the theme of self-awareness and personal responsibility. Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of preparation and risk management, suggesting that wise people anticipate potential long-term consequences before acting."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""A ò mọ ohun tí eléwé-e gbégbé ńtà kó tó sọ pé ọjà ò tà"" roughly translates to ""We don't know what the herb seller has been selling before claiming the market is slow.""
2. This phrase speaks to the importance of knowing background information before making judgments or claims about a situation.
3. It suggests that complaints about outcomes should be contextualized by understanding previous actions or circumstances.
4. There's an emphasis on history and prior context being necessary for proper assessment.

Interim Insight: This similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with the importance of understanding history or background before accepting an inheritance or making claims about what one deserves.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""Where we hear the history before inheriting, we should know that the inheritance there doesn't affect us."" OR ""The place where we must listen to stories before inheriting, know that such inheritance doesn't concern us.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Bí a bá ti mọ là ńkú; olongo kì í kú tìyàntìyàn"" translates to ""One dies as one is known; the lizard doesn't die in an undignified manner.""
2. This phrase emphasizes the importance of reputation, dignity, and living/dying according to one's established character.
3. It suggests that one's identity and behavior should be consistent, and that reputation matters.
4. There's an implication that what is natural or true to oneself should be embraced rather than forced situations.

Interim Insight: This second phrase adds the dimension that one should be wary of situations that require excessive explanations or justifications, as they may not be natural or beneficial to us.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""When one must listen to lengthy explanations before receiving an inheritance, know that such an inheritance is not meant for you.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb advises caution when something that should be straightforward (like receiving what is rightfully yours) comes with many conditions or explanations. In Yoruba culture, legitimate inheritances or benefits should come naturally to those entitled to them. If you find yourself in a situation where you must be convinced or persuaded with stories before receiving something, it suggests that it may not rightfully belong to you or might come with hidden problems. It teaches discernment and warns against being lured by enticing opportunities that require excessive justification, as they may not align with your true path or best interests.

- References: The first similar phrase reinforces the importance of knowing background information before making judgments, while the second phrase emphasizes staying true to one's natural position and dignity rather than forcing oneself into unsuitable situations.

Final Answer: This Yoruba proverb warns that when you must listen to elaborate stories or explanations before receiving an inheritance or benefit, it's a sign that such benefit isn't truly meant for you. It teaches discernment about opportunities that require excessive justification, suggesting that what legitimately belongs to you shouldn't need elaborate convincing. In Yoruba wisdom, this reflects the cultural value of natural alignment - what is truly yours will come without complicated prerequisites or conditions."

Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Àì-lápá làdá ò mú; bí a bá lápá, ọmọ owú to-o gégi"" translates roughly to ""It's lack of strength that makes the machete ineffective; with enough strength, even cotton can cut wood.""
2. This suggests a theme about hierarchy, ability, and appropriate action based on one's position or capability.
3. Both phrases seem to address how to handle situations with limited power or when dealing with authority figures.
4. The similar phrase shows that perceived impossibility might be a matter of approach or strength rather than inherent inability.

Interim Insight: The proverb likely deals with hierarchical relationships and appropriate ways to address problems when authority figures are involved.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""If the household head is stomping/dancing wildly, it is with the rafters/roof beams that we deal with his companion/follower.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The second similar phrase ""Bí a bá ḿbá ọmọdé jẹun lóko, gànmùganmu imú ẹni ní ńwò"" translates approximately to ""When eating with a child in the farm, one watches the tip of one's own nose.""
2. This phrase emphasizes being mindful of one's own conduct when in a position of responsibility or authority.
3. It suggests that interactions across hierarchical levels require careful attention to propriety and self-awareness.
4. This reinforces the idea in our main proverb about indirect approaches to problems involving authority figures.

Interim Insight: When dealing with authority figures who are behaving inappropriately, one should address the issue through indirect means or by focusing on those who enable or follow the authority figure.

## Final Synthesis:
- **Final Translation:** ""If the head of the household is stomping around wildly, we deal with his followers through the roof beams.""

- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb teaches wisdom in handling difficult situations involving authority figures. When a leader or person in power is behaving badly or irrationally, direct confrontation may be unwise. Instead, one should address the situation by dealing with their subordinates or the systems that support them. The proverb uses the metaphor of house architecture - rather than confronting the wild-acting household head directly, one works through structural elements (the rafters) to influence those who follow him. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of respecting hierarchical structures while still finding effective ways to resolve problems.

- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the idea that perceived limitations can be overcome with proper approach and strategy. Similar Phrase 2 highlights the importance of self-awareness and indirect approaches when navigating relationships across different levels of authority.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Bí baálẹ̀-ẹ́ bá ńtàkìtì, òrógi là ḿbá ẹmẹsẹ̀"" means ""If the head of the household is behaving wildly, we deal with his followers through the roof beams."" It teaches that when confronted with irrational or difficult authority figures, the wise approach is not direct confrontation but rather addressing the issue through their supporters or the structures that uphold their authority. This reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on diplomatic problem-solving within hierarchical social structures."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Aaka ò gbé ọ̀dàn; igbó ní ńgbé"" translates to ""The crab doesn't live in the savannah; it lives in the forest/bush."" This indicates natural habitat and the idea that things have their proper place.
2. This suggests appearances can be deceiving, and one should pay attention to who actually accomplishes tasks rather than who appears more capable.
3. The phrase establishes a contrast between two entities (crab and forest) that relates to the contrast in our proverb between ""afínjú"" (elegant/fashionable person) and ""ọ̀bún"" (dirty/filthy person).

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests a theme of appearances versus reality, and that one should not judge capabilities based solely on outward appearance.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""The elegant/fashionable person enters the market walking majestically, the dirty/filthy person enters the market walking slowly/carefully; it is the dirty person who carries the elegant person's load home.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""A gbé gàárì ọmọ ewurẹ ńrojú; kì í ṣe ẹrù àgùntàn"" translates to ""We carry cassava flour and the kid goat is complaining; it is not a sheep's load."" This suggests someone complaining about a burden that isn't theirs to bear.
2. The phrase highlights the idea of misplaced complaints or concerns, particularly when someone who isn't doing the actual work is expressing dissatisfaction.
3. This connects to our proverb by emphasizing the contrast between those who show off (the elegant person) versus those who actually do the work (the dirty person).

Interim Insight: This reinforces the theme that actions and actual contributions matter more than appearances or status. The one who appears less impressive may be the one doing the actual work.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The elegant person enters the market walking majestically, while the dirty person enters the market walking slowly and carefully; yet it is the dirty person who ends up carrying the elegant person's load home.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that appearances can be deceiving. It contrasts the showy, elegant person who displays themselves proudly in public with the humble, perhaps less attractive person who moves more carefully. Despite the elegant person's impressive appearance, it is the unassuming ""dirty"" person who actually does the work and carries the burden. The proverb warns against judging people's worth or capabilities based on their outward appearance or how they present themselves. In Yoruba culture, this reflects values of humility and the importance of actual contribution rather than mere showmanship. It may also critique social hierarchies where those of higher status often rely on the labor of those with lower status.

- References: The proverb connects to Similar Phrase 1 by highlighting the contrast between appearances and reality, and to Similar Phrase 2 by emphasizing that actual work and contribution matter more than status or appearance.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Afínjú wọ ọjà ó rìn gbẹndẹ́kẹ ọ̀bún wọ ọjà ó rìn ṣùẹ̀ṣùẹ̀; ọ̀bùn ní ó ru ẹrù afínjú relé"" means ""The elegant person enters the market walking majestically, while the dirty person enters the market walking slowly; yet it is the dirty person who carries the elegant person's load home."" This Yoruba wisdom teaches that those who make the greatest show of themselves aren't necessarily those who do the actual work. It encourages looking beyond appearances to value people for their real contributions"

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Àjàpá ńlọ sájò, wọ́n ní ìgbà wo ni yó dèé, ó ní ó dìgbàtí òún bá tẹ́"" translates to ""The tortoise is going to a party, they asked when he would arrive, he said when he's ready/when he gets there.""
2. This phrase highlights the tortoise's notorious unhurried pace and indeterminate timing in Yoruba folklore.
3. Both proverbs seem to involve journeys with uncertain outcomes or returns.
4. The tortoise saying he'll arrive ""when he gets there"" suggests noncommittal responses that avoid making concrete promises.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the proverb may be about undertaking journeys with uncertain returns or making promises without fulfillment.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""Cockroach and ant set out on a journey, they said they were going to catch a flying chicken, we saw them depart but never saw them return.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Àgbààgbà ìlú ò lè péjọ kí wọn ó jẹ ìfun òkété, àfi iyán àná"" translates to ""The elders of the town cannot gather together to eat the intestines of a bush rat, only yesterday's pounded yam.""
2. This phrase speaks to impossibility - the intestines of a bush rat are too small for multiple elders to share meaningfully.
3. Both proverbs deal with impractical endeavors or unrealistic expectations.
4. The notion of collective action toward an impossible goal connects with the original proverb about insects trying to catch a flying chicken.

Interim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces the theme of attempting something fundamentally impossible or beyond one's capabilities, which helps explain why the insects in our proverb never returned.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""Cockroach and ant set out on a journey, claiming they were going to catch a flying chicken; we saw them depart but never saw them return.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the folly of undertaking impossible tasks or making grandiose claims beyond one's capabilities. The cockroach and ant represent individuals making unrealistic boasts (catching a flying chicken would be impossible for such small insects). The proverb warns against embarking on journeys or projects with unrealistic goals, as failure is inevitable. It teaches the importance of knowing one's limitations and being practical in one's ambitions. The proverb can be used to caution against empty boasting or undertaking ventures doomed to fail due to their inherent impossibility.

- References: The first similar phrase about the tortoise going to a party highlights the theme of uncertain journeys, while the second phrase about elders eating bush rat intestines reinforces the concept of attempting something fundamentally impossible."
CG-CoT,Anthropic,Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ò mẹ̀yẹ.,A pig does not know what is becoming.,"# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb ""Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ò mẹ̀yẹ.""

Similar Phrase 1: Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ńpàfọ̀, ó rò pé òún ńṣoge.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
> Reflect on how this phrase informs the imagery or symbolism of the proverb.

Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ńpàfọ̀, ó rò pé òún ńṣoge"" translates to ""The pig is wallowing in mud, thinking it is beautifying itself.""
2. This provides important context about pigs in Yoruba culture - they're seen as animals that wallow in filth yet remain unaware of how others perceive them.
3. The imagery suggests self-deception or lack of self-awareness - the pig thinks it's doing something admirable when others see it as dirty or inappropriate.
4. Both phrases involve ""Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀"" (pig), suggesting our main proverb also deals with misperception or lack of awareness.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase indicates that our proverb likely refers to someone doing something inappropriate or lacking proper judgment while being unaware of their limitation.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.

Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""A kì í kó èlé ṣẹ̀ṣọ́"" translates to ""One does not gather pigeons as decorations/ornaments.""
2. This proverb suggests that things should be used according to their proper nature or purpose - pigeons aren't decorative objects.
3. There's a theme of proper categorization and understanding the natural order of things.
4. This connects to our main proverb by reinforcing the idea of knowing one's place, limitations, or proper domain of knowledge.
5. Both proverbs emphasize respecting natural boundaries and limitations.

Interim Insight: The second similar phrase strengthens the interpretation that the original proverb is about staying within one's realm of knowledge or competence and not presuming expertise in areas where one has no experience.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The pig does not know birds.""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against speaking or acting with authority on matters outside one's experience or competence. Just as a pig, a ground-dwelling animal, has no understanding of birds and their ways, people should not presume to have knowledge in areas where they lack expertise. The proverb cautions against overconfidence and encourages humility about the limits of one's knowledge. It's often used to criticize those who speak authoritatively on subjects they know nothing about.
- References: Similar Phrase 1 adds the dimension of self-deception (the pig thinks it's beautifying itself when wallowing in mud), while Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the theme of respecting natural categories and limitations.

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ò mẹ̀yẹ"" literally means ""The pig does not know birds."" It teaches that one should not claim expertise in matters beyond their experience or understanding. Just as pigs, being land animals, have no real understanding of birds and their flight, people should recognize the limits of their knowledge and not speak authoritatively on unfamiliar subjects. This proverb promotes intellectual humility and self-awareness, cautioning against the folly of presuming knowledge where one has none."

Similar Phrase 1: Ìtàkùn tó tó ọ̀pẹ kò tó pé kérin má lọ; ìtàkùn tó pé kérin má lọ Àlọ́, tòun terin ní ńlọ.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. Both phrases involve similar imagery: ""ìtàkùn"" (rope/vine), ""ọ̀pẹ"" (palm tree), and ""erin"" (elephant).
2. The first phrase suggests that a rope as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant from proceeding.
3. Both phrases contain the parallel structure where the rope/chain that is supposed to restrain the elephant ends up going along with the elephant.
4. This suggests a power dynamic - the elephant (representing great strength) cannot be restrained by something relatively insignificant.

Interim Insight: This appears to be a Yoruba proverb about the futility of weak restraints against powerful forces. The image of a rope or chain that ends up going along with the elephant rather than restraining it creates a powerful visual metaphor.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""A chain as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant; the rope that says the elephant should not climb the ọ̀dàn tree, both the rope and the elephant are going together.""

## Step 3 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 2: A ò mọ ohun tí Dárò-ó ní kó tó wí pé olè-é kó òun.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This second phrase translates roughly to ""We don't know what Daro had before claiming he was robbed.""
2. This introduces a skeptical perspective about claims made without evidence.
3. This adds an additional layer to our proverb: not only is the restraint ineffective, but the attempt to control the situation leads to a different outcome than intended.
4. Both phrases deal with situations where expected control or authority fails.

Interim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the theme of powerlessness in the face of greater forces, and suggests that claims of control or authority should be viewed skeptically when actual power is lacking.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""A chain as tall as a palm tree cannot stop an elephant; the rope that forbids the elephant from climbing the ọ̀dàn tree ends up going along with the elephant.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the futility of weak constraints against powerful forces. In Yoruba culture, the elephant symbolizes tremendous strength and unstoppable force. The proverb teaches that attempting to control something or someone with insufficient means is not only futile but may result in the would-be controller being carried along by the force they sought to restrain. It warns against overestimating one's authority or influence and serves as a reminder that real power cannot be contained by symbolic or inadequate restraints. The proverb might be applied to situations where institutional rules, social conventions, or individual commands lack the genuine authority or power needed to be effective.

- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the imagery of the ineffective restraint, while Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of skepticism toward claims of control or authority without sufficient backing.

Final Answer:
The Yoruba proverb ""Ẹ̀wọ̀n tó tó ọ̀pẹ ò tó-ó dá erin dúró; ìtàkùn tó ní kí erin má ròkè ọ̀dàn, tòun terin ní ńlọ"" translates to ""A chain as tall as a palm tree cannot"

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This similar phrase talks about how the Okoro tree is treated with respect and called a kola nut tree, and only the kola nuts that grow on it are sweet/valuable.
2. It suggests a relationship between identity/designation and consequence - something is valued for what it produces, not just what it's called.
3. This relates to our proverb about the lamp extinguisher by suggesting consequences come from actions, not declarations.

Interim Insight: Both proverbs deal with natural consequences that follow from actions rather than intentions or declarations.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation

Similar Phrase 2: Ẹyẹ tó fi ara wé igún, ẹ̀hìn àdìrò ní ńsùn.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This phrase states that ""a bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind a chicken coop"" - meaning a creature that overestimates its abilities or status will find itself in a humble position.
2. It warns against overconfidence and pretending to be something you're not, as reality will eventually assert itself.
3. This connects to our proverb about the wind and lamp - both warn about overestimating one's power and the natural consequences that follow.

Interim Insight: The proverbs share a theme of natural justice - those who overestimate their abilities or make boastful claims will face consequences aligned with their true nature, not their pretensions.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The wind that boasts it will extinguish the lamp will only burn itself.""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against empty boasting and overestimating one's abilities. Just as wind might intend to blow out a lamp but instead gets burned by coming too close to the flame, people who make grand claims beyond their capabilities often harm themselves in the process. The proverb teaches humility and self-awareness, encouraging people to recognize their limitations rather than making boastful claims that may lead to their own downfall. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the value placed on humility (ìwà pẹ̀lẹ́) and the natural justice that follows when one acts contrary to their true nature or capacity.
- References: Similar Phrase 1 reminds us that true value comes from what we produce, not what we claim to be. Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the lesson about false pretenses leading to humbling consequences.

Final Answer:
The Yoruba proverb ""Àfòpiná tó ní òun ó pa fìtílà, ara ẹ̀ ni yó pa"" translates to ""The wind that boasts it will extinguish the lamp will only burn itself."" This proverb warns against empty boasting and overconfidence. In Yoruba wisdom, it teaches that those who overestimate their abilities and make grand claims often end up harming themselves instead. The natural consequence of the wind's interaction with fire parallels how human pretension often leads to self-inflicted damage. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of ìwà pẹ̀lẹ́ (humility) and belief in natural justice - that the universe has a way of humbling those who fail to recognize their true place and limitations."

Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Àgbà kì í wà lọ́jà kórí ọmọ titun wọ́"" translates to ""An elder should not be present in the marketplace and allow a child's head to be improperly positioned/wrapped."" This speaks to the responsibility of elders to guide and correct younger ones.
2. This suggests a theme of dignity, responsibility, and proper social conduct expected from elders in Yoruba society.
3. The original proverb appears to also address the behavior or situation of an elderly person, suggesting something potentially embarrassing or undignified.

Interim Insight: Both proverbs seem to address expectations of elderly behavior, suggesting there are certain standards elders must maintain to preserve their dignity and respect in society.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation

> Explaining how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.

Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Inú burúkú làgbà ńní, àgbà kì í ní ojú burúkú"" translates to ""An elder may have a bad stomach (internal feelings), but an elder should not have a bad face (external expression)."" This speaks to the expectation that elders maintain composure and dignity outwardly regardless of internal struggles.
2. This reinforces the idea that elders are held to higher standards of public conduct and decorum in Yoruba society.
3. The original proverb about mixing fermented guinea corn with banana suggests an inappropriate or foolish action that brings shame to an elder, violating these standards of dignified behavior.

Interim Insight: The proverb appears to be cautioning against actions that bring public shame to elders, reinforcing the cultural expectation that age comes with responsibility to maintain dignity and avoid embarrassing situations.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""An elderly person who mixes fermented guinea corn into a calabash of bananas feels ashamed.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb speaks to the expectations placed on elders in Yoruba society. It uses the imagery of inappropriately mixing foods (which would be considered foolish or wasteful) to illustrate how elders should avoid undignified or inappropriate behaviors that would bring them shame. In Yoruba culture, elders are expected to be repositories of wisdom and models of proper conduct. When they engage in behaviors unbefitting their status, it not only diminishes their personal dignity but also undermines their standing in the community. The proverb serves as a reminder that age comes with responsibility and certain standards of behavior must be maintained to preserve one's honor and respect.

- References: The first similar phrase emphasizes elders' responsibility to guide younger generations, while the second highlights the expectation that elders maintain dignified composure regardless of circumstances. Together, they frame the cultural context in which improper behavior by elders is seen as particularly shameful."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This similar phrase translates roughly to ""My child's name is Ọ̀gà-ǹ-gà, stop calling my child Ògò-ǹ-gò! Which one is the good name there?"" This shows concern about proper naming or identity.
2. It demonstrates how Yoruba people place importance on proper names and titles - calling someone by an incorrect name or title is considered disrespectful.
3. There's a play on similar-sounding names, suggesting confusion or deliberate misrepresentation.

Interim Insight: This provides context that the main proverb likely deals with issues of identity, titles, or naming - and possibly how people react to labels given to them.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""They call you the child of an elephant who cannot trumpet; are you the one who even swallows it?""

## Step 3 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 2: Àjànàkú ò tu lójú alájá; o-nígba-ajá ò gbọdọ̀ tọ́pa erin.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This phrase translates roughly to ""An elephant is not insignificant in the eyes of a dog owner; the owner of two hundred dogs must not follow an elephant's tracks."" This proverb uses elephant imagery to depict power dynamics.
2. In Yoruba culture, elephants (erin/àjànàkú) symbolize great power, size, and significance.
3. The inability to trumpet (in the main proverb) refers to not living up to one's expected abilities or family legacy.

Interim Insight: The elephant symbolism clarifies that the main proverb is about someone who fails to demonstrate expected abilities based on their prestigious lineage or position, yet paradoxically takes offense at this observation.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""They call you the offspring of an elephant that cannot trumpet; are you the one who even swallows the trumpet?""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes someone who fails to live up to their family reputation or expected abilities (like an elephant's child who cannot trumpet), yet becomes offended when this shortcoming is pointed out. It addresses the irony of someone taking offense at a truth about their inadequacy. In Yoruba culture, this proverb teaches that one should acknowledge one's limitations rather than become defensive when they are mentioned. It's often used when someone reacts angrily to criticism that accurately points out their failure to meet expectations based on their background or position.

- References: The first similar phrase demonstrates the importance of proper naming and identity in Yoruba culture, while the second phrase establishes the elephant as a symbol of power and significance, making the inability to trumpet (a natural elephant ability) more meaningful as a metaphor for failing to live up to one's heritage.

Final Answer: The proverb criticizes someone who gets offended when their failure to live up to their family legacy or position is pointed out, similar to an elephant's child who cannot trumpet yet becomes angry when this inadequacy is mentioned."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ṣáláporẹ́ ò mọ ẹgbẹ́ ẹ̀ nínú omi"" translates to ""The lizard doesn't recognize its peers in water"" - suggesting how creatures (or people) naturally recognize and associate with their own kind
2. This relates to the main proverb through the concept of ""ẹgbẹ́"" (peers/group/equals) appearing in both, suggesting natural affinity and association between similar entities
3. The similar phrase implies that context can affect recognition of peers, while our main proverb seems to focus on deliberate association

Interim Insight: The similar phrase helps establish that the main proverb likely deals with social associations and how people naturally seek out those of similar standing.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""The wealthy person walks with the prosperous; peers play with peers.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Aaka ò gbé ọ̀dàn; igbó ní ńgbé"" translates to ""The viper doesn't live in the savanna; it lives in the forest"" - indicating natural habitats and appropriate environments
2. This phrase reinforces the idea that things/beings have their natural places and associations
3. It adds the dimension that there's a natural order to relationships and associations - just as certain animals belong in certain habitats, certain people naturally associate with others like themselves

Interim Insight: This second phrase strengthens the interpretation that the main proverb speaks to natural social ordering and appropriate associations based on similarity or status.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The wealthy person walks with the prosperous; peers play with peers.""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes that people naturally associate with those of similar status, wealth, or circumstances. It reflects the Yoruba cultural understanding of social stratification and natural affinities. The proverb serves both as an observation of social dynamics and a cautionary wisdom about knowing one's place in society. Just as creatures have their natural habitats and companions, humans tend to form relationships with those who share similar life experiences, resources, and status. This isn't necessarily presented as negative, but rather as a natural social principle to be acknowledged.
- References: The lizard not recognizing its peers in water speaks to natural grouping, while the viper living in the forest not the savanna reinforces that entities have their natural associations and environments.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Olówó ní ḿbá ọlọ́rọ̀-ọ́ rìn; ẹgbẹ́ ní ḿbá ẹgbẹ́ ṣeré"" translates to ""The wealthy person walks with the prosperous; peers play with peers."" In Yoruba culture, this expresses the natural tendency for people to associate with others of similar social standing, wealth, or circumstances. Like the viper that belongs in the forest, not the savanna, people gravitate toward environments and relationships that match their status and identity. The proverb acknowledges social stratification as a natural phenomenon while suggesting we should understand where we belong in the social fabric."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Ọlọgbọ́n ò tẹ ara ẹ̀ nÍfá; ọ̀mọ̀ràn ò fi ara ẹ̀ joyè; abẹ tó mú ò lè gbẹ́ èkù ara ẹ̀"" translates roughly to ""A wise person doesn't make himself a diviner; a knowledgeable person doesn't make himself a chief; a sharp knife cannot shave its own handle.""
2. This speaks to the limitations of self-service and the importance of recognizing one's position and limitations, even when skilled or powerful.
3. It suggests that everyone has roles they cannot fulfill for themselves, indicating a social order where interdependence is necessary.

Interim Insight: This similar phrase emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's limitations and proper place in the social order, which appears to relate to the theme of self-awareness in our target proverb.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""Let the slave know himself as a slave; let the pawn know himself as a pawn; let the person of good character know himself as a servant of God the king.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The phrase ""Ọjọ́ tí mo ti ḿbọ̀ ng ò rírú ẹ̀ rí"": olúwa ẹ̀-ẹ́ mọ ìwọ̀n ara ẹ̀ ni"" roughly translates to ""Since I've been worshipping, I've never seen its like"": the master/owner knows his own worth/limits.""
2. This phrase suggests that recognizing one's limitations and worth is a sign of wisdom and proper self-understanding.
3. It reinforces the idea that even those in positions of authority (masters/owners) must understand their own boundaries and limitations.

Interim Insight: This second phrase adds the dimension that self-awareness applies to everyone regardless of social status, and that understanding one's position is a form of wisdom, not just submission.

## Final Synthesis:
- **Final Translation:** ""Let the slave recognize their position as a slave; let the indentured servant recognize their position as such; let the person of good character recognize themselves as a servant of God the king.""

- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb speaks to the importance of self-awareness and acceptance of one's position in the social and cosmic order. In traditional Yoruba society, understanding one's place was crucial for social harmony. However, the proverb moves beyond mere social hierarchy to make a profound spiritual point: regardless of social status, everyone (even those of high moral standing - ọmọlúwàbí) ultimately serves God. This creates a universal humility that transcends earthly status. The proverb doesn't necessarily endorse slavery or servitude as institutions, but uses these social categories to illustrate that self-knowledge and understanding one's relationship to divine authority brings wisdom and proper conduct. For the Yoruba, recognizing one's position in relation to others and to God represents spiritual maturity and social responsibility.

- **References:** Both similar phrases reinforce the core message that self-awareness of one's limitations and proper place is essential for all individuals regardless of status, and that even those with power or virtue must recognize a higher authority."

## Step 0 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 1: Ẹni tí a bá ńdáṣọ fún kì í ka èèwọ̀.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Ẹni tí a bá ńdáṣọ fún kì í ka èèwọ̀"" translates to ""The person for whom a garment is being sewn should not dictate the taboos/restrictions."" This suggests a power dynamic where the recipient of a service shouldn't be dictating terms to the provider.
2. This relates to traditional Yoruba contexts where specialists (like tailors) have expertise that should be respected. The recipient shouldn't try to overstep their position by acting more knowledgeable than the specialist.

Interim Insight: This similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with respecting the expertise of specialists or professionals and not claiming to know more than them, particularly in ritual or professional contexts.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""One should not be wiser than the person who will cast Ifá divination for them.""

Similar Phrase 2: Ẹni tí a lè gbé kì í dawọ́.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ẹni tí a lè gbé kì í dawọ́"" translates to ""The person who is being carried shouldn't stretch out their hands."" This refers to someone who is being helped (carried) shouldn't try to do things themselves or interfere with the helper's method.
2. This reinforces the message about hierarchies of expertise and the appropriate behavior when receiving help or service from someone with specialized knowledge.

Interim Insight: Both similar phrases emphasize the importance of respecting expertise and not interfering when someone is providing you with a specialized service, whether it's divination, tailoring, or physical assistance.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""One should not claim to be wiser than the person performing Ifá divination for them.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb addresses the relationship between a diviner (babalawo) and their client. In Yoruba culture, Ifá divination is a complex spiritual system requiring years of training and deep knowledge. The proverb cautions against arrogance when consulting experts, particularly spiritual ones. It reminds us to respect specialized knowledge and not presume to know more than those whose expertise we seek. This extends beyond divination to any professional-client relationship where specialized knowledge is involved. The wisdom emphasizes humility when seeking guidance and acknowledging the boundaries between the roles of service provider and recipient.

- References: The proverb's meaning is illuminated by Similar Phrase 1 (about not dictating terms to a tailor) and Similar Phrase 2 (about not interfering when being carried), both reinforcing the cultural value of respecting expertise and maintaining appropriate roles in service relationships.

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""A kì í gbọ́n ju ẹni tí a máa dÍfá fún"" means ""One should not claim to be wiser than the person performing Ifá divination for them."" It teaches the importance of respecting experts in their domain and maintaining humility when seeking specialized services. In Yoruba culture, this especially applies to spiritual consultations with Ifá diviners (babalawos), but extends to all professional relationships where specialized knowledge is involved. The proverb warns against the arrogance of thinking you know more than the expert whose help you're seeking."

(Translation: Poverty doesn't originate from one place; suffering doesn't come from one source; if you walk in poverty, if you enter a town in a state of destitution, they will give you water to drink in any available container.)

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase speaks about how one's condition follows them regardless of location - poverty isn't tied to geography but to circumstance.
2. It suggests that one's status determines how they're treated in society - a poor person will be served water in whatever container is available, indicating minimal respect.

Interim Insight: This suggests our proverb may also deal with how one's circumstances or status follows them regardless of location, and how people are treated based on their perceived standing in society.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat is still eating like that.""

## Step 3 – Context Injection
Similar Phrase 2: A-báni-gbé kì í yáná; a-bọ̀rìṣà kì í sun òtútù; ẹyin gẹ́gẹ́ kì í gbé àwùjọ́; ilé kannáà ni wọ́n kọ́ fún àwọn mẹ́tẹ̀ẹ̀ta.
(Translation: One who lives with others won't lack fire; a devotee of the gods won't suffer cold; a broken egg doesn't stay among the whole ones; the same house was built for all three of them.)

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This phrase emphasizes how one's associations and identity determine their experiences - those who live in community have certain advantages, while those who are ""broken"" (like a broken egg) cannot remain among the whole.
2. It suggests a natural order where similar things group together and dissimilar things are separated.

Interim Insight: Combined with our proverb, this suggests that Amodu's situation in Ilorin and the goat's continuing behavior reflect a natural consistency - things continue as they are despite changes in location or attempts to alter circumstances.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat is still eating like that.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb speaks to the persistence of nature and character regardless of location or intervention. Just as Amodu's situation in Ilorin hasn't changed, the goat continues its natural behavior of eating in its characteristic way. The proverb teaches that fundamental nature is difficult to change - people and animals tend to maintain their essential character and habits regardless of attempts to change them or changes in their environment. It can be used to comment on the futility of trying to change someone's inherent nature or to observe that despite new circumstances, old patterns persist.

- References: The first similar phrase reinforces how circumstances follow a person regardless of location, while the second phrase emphasizes how natural order tends to maintain itself, with each thing remaining true to its nature.

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""Kí ni wọ́n ti ńṣe Àmọ́dù nÍlọrin? Ewúrẹ́ ńjẹ́ bẹ́ẹ̀"" translates to ""What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat is still eating like that."" It conveys that despite changes in location or circumstances, one's essential nature remains unchanged. Just as a goat continues to eat in its characteristic way regardless of what's happening elsewhere, people tend to maintain their fundamental character despite external changes or interventions.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Babaaláwo kì í bèrè ẹbọ àná"" translates to ""A diviner does not ask about yesterday's sacrifice"" or ""A babalawo doesn't inquire about sacrifices from the past.""
2. This suggests something about expertise, roles, and responsibilities - a true expert knows their domain and doesn't need to ask basic questions about completed tasks.
3. This might suggest our target proverb also deals with authenticity, competence, or the nature of expertise.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the proverb may be about recognizing true expertise or natural abilities versus imitation or pretense.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""One creates/makes a dove that goes 'bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀'"" or ""We create a dove that sounds 'bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀'""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Afínjúu Ààré; ó fi àkísà dí orùbà; ó ńwá ẹniire-é bá sú epo"" translates roughly to ""The fastidious person of Aare; who wraps rags as head-tie; who seeks someone to prepare palm oil soup with.""
2. This phrase is about pretentiousness or false appearances - someone who tries to appear wealthy or sophisticated while lacking basic necessities.
3. Combined with our initial proverb, this suggests the theme is about inauthenticity or imitation - attempting to create something that isn't genuine.

Interim Insight: Both similar phrases point to a theme of false pretenses or imitation versus authenticity. The dove making an unnatural sound ""bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀"" represents something artificial trying to pass as genuine.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""One creates a dove that sounds 'bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀'"" (instead of the natural cooing sound)
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb critiques artificial imitation or pretense. A dove naturally has a specific cooing sound, and one that makes an unnatural sound like ""bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀"" is clearly fake or manufactured. It's used to describe situations where someone is attempting to pass off something inauthentic as genuine, or someone pretending to be what they are not. Like the babalawo who should know his craft without asking basic questions, or the pretentious person wearing rags while seeking luxury, the proverb warns against artificiality and celebrates authenticity.
- References: The first similar phrase about the babalawo highlights expertise and authenticity, while the second phrase about the pretentious person emphasizes the futility of false appearances.

Final Answer:
The Yoruba proverb ""A-dá-má-lè-ṣe àdàbà tí ńdún bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀"" translates to ""One creates a dove that makes the sound 'bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀'."" In Yoruba cultural context, this proverb points to inauthenticity or poor imitation. A genuine dove makes its natural cooing sound, so one that makes the strange sound ""bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀"" is obviously artificial. This proverb is used to describe situations where people pretend to be what they're not or when something counterfeit is trying to pass as authentic. It teaches the value of genuineness and warns against deception through poor imitation."

> Reflect on how this phrase informs the imagery or symbolism of the proverb.
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""A kì í dákẹ́ ká ṣìwí; a kì í wò sùn-ùn ká dáràn"" translates roughly to ""One does not keep silent and misspeak; one does not stare blankly and act wrongly."" This suggests accountability in actions and speech.
2. Both phrases use the structure ""kì í"" which indicates something that should not be done - a prohibition or improper action in Yoruba cultural context.
3. The similar phrase emphasizes consciousness and intentionality in actions, suggesting our target proverb may also speak to deliberate action and responsibility.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with proper conduct, accountability, or the relationship between action and consequence.

Similar Phrase 2: Àgbà kì í ṣerée kí-ló-bá-yìí-wá?

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Àgbà kì í ṣerée kí-ló-bá-yìí-wá?"" translates to ""An elder doesn't play the game of 'what brought this about?'"" meaning elders should take responsibility rather than feigning ignorance about consequences.
2. This reinforces the theme of accountability present in our target proverb - just as elders should own their actions, so too should drummers acknowledge the music they create.
3. The dùndún is a talking drum in Yoruba culture that ""speaks"" the Yoruba tonal language, so the drummer has direct agency and responsibility for the ""words"" produced.

Interim Insight: The cultural significance of the dùndún as a communication tool adds depth to the proverb - it's not just about music but about communication, expression, and taking ownership of one's words and actions.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""One who beats the dùndún drum cannot deny [responsibility for] the music [it produces].""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes personal accountability for one's actions and their consequences. In Yoruba culture, the dùndún is not merely a musical instrument but a communication tool that ""speaks"" through its tones. The drummer deliberately creates specific sounds, so claiming no responsibility for what emerges would be absurd. The proverb teaches that we must own the consequences of our deliberate actions, just as a drummer must acknowledge the music they create. It applies broadly to situations where people attempt to distance themselves from the natural outcomes of their own actions.
- References: The accountability theme in ""A kì í dákẹ́ ká ṣìwí; a kì í wò sùn-ùn ká dáràn"" and the elder's responsibility in ""Àgbà kì í ṣerée kí-ló-bá-yìí-wá?"" both reinforce the cultural value of owning one's actions and their consequences.

Final Answer: The proverb ""A-lu-dùndún kì í dárin"" translates to ""One who beats the dùndún drum cannot deny responsibility for the music it produces."" It teaches that we must take responsibility for our actions and their consequences. In Yoruba culture, where the talking drum literally ""speaks"" through the drummer's skill, this imagery powerfully conveys that we cannot separate ourselves from what we deliberately create or cause. This wisdom applies whenever someone tries to disown the predictable outcomes of their own choices."

Similar Phrase 1: Aláṣọ-kan kì í ṣeré òjò.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
> Reflect on how this phrase informs the imagery or symbolism of the proverb.

Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Aláṣọ-kan"" refers to a person who has only one cloth/garment, while ""kì í ṣeré òjò"" means ""doesn't play in the rain.""
2. This similar phrase suggests that someone with limited resources (only one cloth) cannot afford to take risks (playing in the rain) that could damage their only possession.
3. The concept emphasizes prudence when one has limited resources - the person must be careful with their sole possession.
4. This helps understand the original proverb's likely focus on resource management and caution.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase indicates that the original proverb likely addresses prudent behavior when one has limited resources, specifically related to clothing or material possessions.

Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""A kì í pe ìyàwó kó kan alárẹnà"" translates roughly to ""One doesn't call a bride to affect the go-between/intermediary.""
2. This proverb suggests that people should respect established protocols and hierarchies - the bride shouldn't bypass or interfere with the intermediary's role.
3. It speaks to the importance of respecting boundaries and roles within Yoruba cultural contexts.
4. This adds a dimension of social boundaries and proper conduct to the interpretation of our original proverb.

Interim Insight: The second similar phrase suggests that the original proverb may also relate to proper social conduct, responsibilities, and knowing one's limitations within community structures.

## Final Synthesis:
- **Final Translation:** ""A person with only one cloth doesn't lend it out to others to dry.""
- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb teaches prudence and self-preservation when one has limited resources. Just as a person with only one garment cannot afford to lend it to others (as they would have nothing to wear), people should be careful about depleting their limited resources by trying to help others. It emphasizes the importance of securing one's own stability before extending help to others. In Yoruba culture, where community support is valued but personal responsibility is essential, this proverb reminds individuals to balance generosity with self-preservation. It acknowledges that one must first take care of their own basic needs before being in a position to assist others.
- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 (""A person with only one cloth doesn't play in the rain"") reinforces the message of protecting limited resources, while Similar Phrase 2 relates to understanding proper social boundaries and responsibilities.

Final Answer:
The Yoruba proverb ""Aláṣọ-kan kì í ná ànárẹ"" translates to ""A person with only one cloth doesn't lend it out to others to dry."" It teaches that those with limited resources must be prudent about how they use or share them. In Yoruba wisdom, while generosity is valued, one must first ensure their own basic needs are met before extending help to others. The proverb serves as practical advice about self-preservation and responsible resource management within community contexts."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Orí àgbà-á níyì, ó sàn ju orí àgbà-á fọ́ lọ"" translates to ""The elder's head is respected/honored, it is better than the elder's head being broken.""
2. This phrase emphasizes respect for elders and suggests that preserving an elder's dignity is better than seeing them dishonored or harmed.
3. Both phrases use the comparative structure ""ó sàn ju... lọ"" (it is better than...), suggesting the original proverb also compares two states involving elders.
4. Both phrases appear to address the proper treatment and dignity of elders in Yoruba culture.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely contrasts two possible conditions for elders, with one being preferable to the other from a cultural perspective of dignity and respect.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""The day an elder dies is better than the day an elder is disgraced/humiliated.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The second similar phrase ""Bí ọjàá bá tú tán, a ku olórí-i pàtẹpàtẹ, a ku àgbààgbà sà-ǹkò sà-ǹkò lọ́jà; bÍfá bá pẹ̀dí tán, ìwọ̀-ǹwọ̀ a dìde"" roughly translates to ""When the market disperses, we salute the chiefs respectfully, we salute the elders scattered throughout the market; when Ifa divination is completed, people stand up.""
2. This phrase highlights the cultural practices of showing respect to elders and authority figures even in everyday settings like marketplaces.
3. It reinforces the importance of maintaining social hierarchies and proper protocols of respect in Yoruba society.
4. The phrase demonstrates how respect for elders is woven into daily activities and social interactions.

Interim Insight: This second phrase adds context about how elders are positioned in Yoruba society - they are to be acknowledged with respect in all settings. This helps us understand why disgrace would be considered worse than death in our original proverb.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""It is better for an elder to die than to be disgraced.""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb reflects the profound Yoruba cultural value placed on dignity, honor, and respect, particularly for elders. In Yoruba culture, elders are repositories of wisdom, guardians of tradition, and embodiments of ancestral connection. The proverb suggests that death, which is a natural end to life, is preferable to living with shame or disgrace that destroys one's dignity and social standing. This sentiment underscores how seriously Yoruba culture takes matters of honor and shame - death itself is considered less severe than the social death that comes with disgrace. The proverb teaches that preserving one's integrity and dignity until death is among the highest virtues.
- References: The first similar phrase reinforces the importance of respecting elders' dignity above all else. The second similar phrase demonstrates how respect for elders is deeply embedded in daily Yoruba social interactions."

Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Àgbéré lẹyẹ ńgbé; kò lè mu omi inú àgbọn"" translates to ""Birds perch fleetingly/temporarily; they cannot drink water from inside a coconut.""
2. This phrase establishes that birds have a limitation - they cannot access water that is inside a coconut.
3. The imagery suggests a natural limitation based on physical capability or design.
4. There's a contrast between the bird's freedom of movement (flying/perching) and its inability to access something contained within a closed space.

Interim Insight: The proverb uses the bird and coconut as symbols to express natural limitations. The bird represents a being with certain capabilities (flight) but also inherent limitations (inability to access enclosed water).

1. The phrase ""Àpárá ńlá ni iná ńdá; iná ò lè rí omi gbéṣe"" translates to ""Fire makes big flames; fire cannot see water to put itself out.""
2. This introduces another natural element (fire) that has both power (creating flames) and limitation (inability to extinguish itself).
3. Both proverbs follow a similar structure: an entity with certain abilities cannot perceive or access something that lies outside its natural capacity.
4. The concept of inherent limitations despite having other strengths is reinforced.

Interim Insight: These proverbs establish a Yoruba philosophical concept about natural limitations - even powerful or capable entities have boundaries they cannot cross due to their inherent nature.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""A bird cannot see the water inside a coconut to drink it.""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the natural limitations that all beings have, regardless of their strengths in other areas. It teaches humility by highlighting that everyone has boundaries defined by their nature or position. The proverb can be applied to human contexts where people might overestimate their abilities or try to access knowledge or resources beyond their reach. It counsels self-awareness about one's limitations and the acceptance of natural boundaries. In Yoruba philosophy, understanding and accepting one's limitations is considered wisdom rather than weakness.
- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of natural limitations using the same imagery of birds and coconuts. Similar Phrase 2 extends this philosophical concept to other natural elements (fire), showing this is a broader principle in Yoruba thought about the natural order of capabilities and limitations.

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""Ẹyẹ ò lè rí omi inú àgbọn bù mu"" translates to ""A bird cannot see the water inside a coconut to drink it."" It teaches that all beings have natural limitations regardless of their other capabilities.

3. Both phrases contain ""tán"" (completely/finished) and deal with consequences of actions or inaction.

Interim Insight: This reinforces that our proverb warns about overconfidence in knowledge leading to downfall - just as the gravedigger who stays too long risks an unwanted outcome.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""It is with 'I know it completely' that Oro carries away a man.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against overconfidence or presumed expertise. Oro is a powerful deity in Yoruba tradition associated with ancestral spirits and sometimes death. The proverb suggests that excessive confidence in one's knowledge (""I know it completely"") often leads to downfall or destruction. It cautions against arrogance and reminds us that claiming complete knowledge of something dangerous can lead to serious consequences. Just as those who claim to fully understand Oro's mysteries might be the ones carried away by the deity, those who boast of complete mastery often fall victim to their own overconfidence.

- References: The first similar phrase reminds us that awareness should be continuous and humble, while the second similar phrase reinforces the idea that knowing when something is complete (and respecting boundaries) is crucial for safety.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Mo mọ̀-ọ́ tán"" lOrò-ó fi ńgbé ọkùnrin means ""It is with 'I know it completely' that Oro carries away a man."" This Yoruba wisdom warns against the dangers of overconfidence. In Yoruba culture, Oro is a powerful ancestral deity associated with mysteries and sometimes death. The proverb teaches that those who boast of complete knowledge or mastery are often the ones who suffer consequences.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This phrase translates roughly to ""What is the seller of gbégbé leaves selling that makes him/her say the market is not profitable?""
2. This proverb questions why someone with a specific role or responsibility would complain about lack of success.
3. It suggests that focus and specialization are important - one should concentrate on their specific trade rather than complaining about general market conditions.
4. This adds the dimension of focused effort and specialization to our understanding of the main proverb.

Interim Insight: This reinforces that the main proverb is about the importance of focusing on one task at a time and not dividing attention between multiple efforts simultaneously.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""When we are arranging corn, we don't arrange guinea corn at the same time.""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches the wisdom of focused attention and avoiding multitasking. In Yoruba agricultural traditions, different grains require different sorting and processing methods. The proverb advises that one should complete one task before moving to another, rather than attempting to do multiple things simultaneously and doing none well. It emphasizes the importance of prioritization, patience, and methodical work - core values in Yoruba culture. Just as a farmer must give proper attention to each crop in its time, people should focus their energies on one important task at a time to ensure quality results.
- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces how resources flow to where we focus our attention. Similar Phrase 2 emphasizes the importance of specialization and focused effort in one's responsibilities.

Final Answer: ""When we are arranging corn, we don't arrange guinea corn at the same time"" - This Yoruba proverb teaches the wisdom of focused attention and completing one task before beginning another. In traditional Yoruba culture, different grains require different handling techniques, making it inefficient to process them simultaneously. The proverb counsels against multitasking, instead advocating for complete attention to one priority before moving to the next.

4. There's an element of ingratitude or unreasonable rejection of what's being offered.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with the rejection of something beneficial without good reason, possibly highlighting ingratitude or poor judgment.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""Your younger sibling is sewing clothes for you, you say you don't patronize the seller of ekuru (bean cake); who then patronizes the seller of akara (fried bean cake)?""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ẹ̀gbọ́n ṣíwájú ó so aṣọ kọ́; àbúrò-ó kẹ́hìn ó wẹ̀wù; bí a ò mọ̀lẹ, ọ̀lẹ ò mọ araa rẹ̀?"" translates to ""The elder sibling in front ties cloth; the younger sibling behind wears gown; if we don't recognize laziness, does laziness not recognize itself?""

4. There's an element of accountability and self-awareness in familial relationships.

Interim Insight: This second phrase reinforces that our proverb likely addresses familial relationships, specifically the proper acknowledgment of help and support from family members, and the importance of appreciating what relatives do for us.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""Your younger sibling is sewing clothes for you, yet you claim you don't patronize the seller of ekuru (bean cake); who then patronizes the seller of akara (fried bean cake)?""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes ingratitude and the failure to appreciate help from close relations. It points out the contradiction of rejecting assistance from someone close to you (your younger sibling) while claiming you don't support certain people. Ekuru and akara are both bean-based foods, with akara generally being more popular than ekuru. The proverb uses this food comparison to highlight the absurdity of the situation - if you won't even accept help from your own family (analogous to not buying from the ekuru seller), then who would you accept help from (who would buy from the akara seller)? In Yoruba culture, family bonds and reciprocal support are highly valued, and this proverb serves as a reminder to appreciate and acknowledge the contributions of family members, especially when they go out of their way to help you.

- References: The first similar phrase highlights the irony of rejecting something of value, while the second reinforces the importance of recognizing and respecting familial roles and contributions."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Bí a bá ti mọ là ńkú; olongo kì í kú tìyàntìyàn"" translates to ""One dies the way one is known (or according to one's character); a respected person doesn't die disgracefully.""

3. Both proverbs start with ""Bí"" (if), suggesting conditional reasoning in Yoruba philosophical thinking.
4. The similar phrase emphasizes how one's reputation and character determine one's legacy, suggesting a link to personal habits and consistency.

Interim Insight: The proverb likely addresses the relationship between personal character/habits and natural consequences, possibly focusing on morning routines as symbolic of one's character.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""If it were not part of a person's nature (or bad habit), who would wake up in the morning and not wash their face?""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb uses the universal act of washing one's face in the morning as a metaphor for basic decency and normal human behavior. It suggests that when someone consistently fails to do what is obviously expected or beneficial, it reveals something fundamental about their character rather than being a simple oversight. In Yoruba culture, personal hygiene is linked to moral cleanliness, and this proverb teaches that habitual neglect of basic responsibilities reflects a character flaw rather than a mere mistake. The proverb can be applied to situations where someone repeatedly fails to meet basic expectations, suggesting their behavior stems from their inherent nature rather than circumstances.

The proverb may be used when advocating for proper attribution, respect for intellectual contributions, or honoring those who educate others.

- References: The first similar phrase about the termite hill suggests steady growth and advancement, similar to how respect and recognition accumulate. The second phrase about learning lessons properly reinforces the importance of acknowledging those who teach us, lest we suffer from ignorance.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Àpọ́nlé ni 'İyá-a Káà'; ìyá kan ò sí ní káà tí kò lórúkọ"" means that every mother who teaches (reading, counting, or knowledge) deserves proper recognition through a specific name or title.

3. The similar phrase implies that circumstances affect how people communicate or what they say.

Interim Insight: This suggests our proverb likely deals with how a difficult situation (something burning) prompts a particular kind of speech or communication.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Bí ojú bá rí, ẹnu a dákẹ́"" translates to ""When the eye sees (something disturbing), the mouth becomes silent"" - suggesting that shocking situations can render one speechless.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""When the soup starts burning, it causes conversation.""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that urgent problems demand immediate attention and discussion. In Yoruba culture, cooking is an important daily activity, and burning soup represents a domestic crisis that requires immediate intervention.

It can be applied to situations where an emergency or crisis forces people to address issues they might otherwise avoid discussing.
- References: The first similar phrase shows how circumstances affect speech, while the second shows the contrast between situations that silence us versus those that prompt urgent communication.

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""Bí iná bá dun ọbẹ̀, a dá ọ̀rọ̀ sọ"" means ""When the soup starts burning, it causes conversation.""

The proverb cautions against assuming others need our sympathy when they may have a different understanding of their circumstances. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the value placed on personal perspective and the recognition that external judgment may be misplaced. It reminds us that before feeling sorry for others, we should consider whether they actually see themselves as unfortunate.

Interim Insight: The original proverb suggests that the most effective way to deal with someone is to use methods they understand or that match their own approach - especially when dealing with difficult people.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""It is the mute person's sword that is used to kill a mute person.""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that the most effective way to address a challenge is to use methods familiar to or derived from the source of the challenge itself. When dealing with difficult people or situations, using approaches they understand or that match their own tactics is often most effective. The proverb specifically uses the image of a mute person, suggesting that specialized knowledge or insider understanding is needed to effectively address specialized challenges. This reflects the Yoruba wisdom of strategic thinking and cultural emphasis on appropriate, targeted responses rather than generic solutions.
- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces that things must be addressed according to their demonstrated nature. Similar Phrase 2 emphasizes that authentic action defines identity and determines appropriate response.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Idà ahun la fi ńpa ahun"" literally means ""It is the mute person's sword that is used to kill a mute person."" In Yoruba wisdom, this conveys that the most effective way to address a challenging person or situation is to use methods derived from or familiar to that very source. Just as only another mute person fully understands how to communicate with a mute person, sometimes the solution to a problem must come from understanding the problem's own nature. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of strategic wisdom and appropriate, targeted responses rather than generic approaches."

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""À ńgé e lọ́wọ́, ó ḿbọ òrùka"" translates to ""We are cutting his hand, and he's putting on a ring"" - suggesting someone doing something inappropriate for the situation.
2. This implies a contrast between size and appropriateness - a ring doesn't belong on a hand being amputated, suggesting improper timing or priorities.
3. In the main proverb, there's a similar contrast between children and adults with mentions of food (oúnjẹ) and rings (òrùka).

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the proverb may be about inappropriate actions or mismatched relationships between children and adults, particularly around things that can fit (food entering an adult's body, but a child's ring not fitting an adult's finger).

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""A small child's food can enter an adult's stomach; a small child's ring cannot fit on an adult's finger.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Ọmọdé ní ẹẹ́ta lọ́wọ́, ó ní kí Èṣù wá ká ṣeré owó; ẹẹ́ta-á ha tó Èṣùú sú epo lá?"" translates roughly to ""A child has three cowries and invites Èṣù (a deity) to come play a money game; are three cowries enough for Èṣù to buy palm oil?""
2. This phrase highlights the disparity between a child's limited resources and an adult deity's needs - suggesting naivety on the child's part.
3. It reinforces the idea of improper scale or mismatch between what children offer and what adults require.

Interim Insight: The second similar phrase emphasizes the mismatch of scale between children and adults, particularly regarding possessions and needs. It suggests the main proverb is about recognizing differences in capacity and scale between generations.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""A small child's food can enter an adult's stomach; a small child's ring cannot fit on an adult's finger.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the selective nature of sharing or exchanges between generations. While adults can consume and benefit from what children offer as food (metaphorically including their ideas, contributions, or resources), not everything from children is suitable for adults (like their rings won't fit adult fingers). It teaches humility to adults - they should accept valuable contributions from younger people even while recognizing differences in capacity and experience. It also speaks to the natural limitations in generational exchanges while encouraging openness to what can be shared. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the balanced respect between generations: respecting elders' wisdom while also acknowledging that youth can contribute meaningfully to society.

- References: The first similar phrase warns against inappropriate actions, reinforcing the proverb's lesson about recognizing proper relationships. The second similar phrase highlights the limitations of what children can offer adults, emphasizing the need for realistic expectations in cross-generational exchanges."

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""A wife who beats her stepchild is simply looking for conversation (or trouble).""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb reveals the complex family dynamics in polygamous households. It suggests that when a wife mistreats her stepchild (her co-wife's child), her real intention is not discipline but to provoke a reaction or conflict with the child's mother or other family members. The proverb speaks to the indirect communication patterns in Yoruba culture, where actions often carry hidden agendas. It warns against using innocent parties (children) as pawns in adult conflicts and highlights how such behavior exposes one's true character. In traditional Yoruba society, harmony in extended families is highly valued, and this proverb serves as both a caution against and an interpretation of disruptive behavior in blended families.

- References: The first similar phrase illustrates how actions can be invitations for dialogue in Yoruba communication patterns. The second phrase reinforces how inappropriate behavior reflects poorly on the individual rather than their position or what they represent, emphasizing personal accountability in Yoruba social ethics."

When someone expresses surprise or amazement at something unusual, it indicates they recognize the boundaries of their own experience and knowledge. In Yoruba culture, acknowledging one's limitations is considered virtuous and a sign of wisdom, not weakness.

- Final Translation: ""Not having the opportunity to rule is better than saying 'My voice cannot reach the whole town.'""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches about humility, self-awareness, and dignity. It suggests that it's better to not have power at all than to have a position of authority but be ineffective or incapable of fulfilling its responsibilities. In Yoruba culture, leadership comes with expectations of effectiveness and impact. The proverb criticizes those who accept positions but then make excuses for their ineffectiveness (""my voice cannot reach the whole town""). It encourages people to honestly assess their capabilities before taking on responsibilities, as having a title without the ability to fulfill its duties is worse than not having the title at all. The proverb values integrity and effectiveness over mere status or titles.

4. The imagery centers on clothing that doesn't belong to you causing discomfort or embarrassment.

Interim Insight: This similar phrase suggests the proverb is about how borrowed items (particularly clothes) don't suit a person as well as their own possessions, and may even cause embarrassment or difficulty.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""Borrowed money does not suit one; borrowed trousers do not suit a person; if it doesn't fit one's legs it becomes awkward/uncomfortable; one's own things are what suit one.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The second similar phrase ""Ọ̀ṣọ́ ọlọ́ṣọ̀ọ́ ò yẹni; ṣòkòtò àgbàbọ̀ ò yẹ́ ọmọ èèyàn"" reinforces the idea from the first phrase.
2. It states that another person's adornment/decoration doesn't suit one, and borrowed trousers don't suit a person.
3. This adds the dimension of appearance and social perception - borrowed finery doesn't enhance one's dignity.
4. The repeated use of ""ò yẹ"" (does not suit/fit) emphasizes the mismatch between borrowed items and the borrower.

Interim Insight: This second phrase confirms the proverb is about authenticity and the importance of using what naturally belongs to you rather than borrowed possessions, which extends beyond physical fit to social appropriateness.

## Final Synthesis:
- **Final Translation:** ""Borrowed money does not suit one; borrowed trousers do not suit a person; if they don't fit one's legs they become awkward; one's own possessions are what truly suit one.""

- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb emphasizes authenticity and self-reliance. It uses the concrete imagery of ill-fitting borrowed trousers to illustrate the broader principle that borrowed possessions—whether material goods or affected mannerisms—never truly suit a person. The proverb warns against pretentiousness and living beyond one's means. In Yoruba culture, this reflects values of contentment, authenticity, and the importance of living within one's natural circumstances rather than putting on appearances with borrowed resources. The wisdom suggests that dignity comes from authenticity rather than pretense, and that one should take pride in what is genuinely one's own rather than depending on others' possessions.

- **References:** Both similar phrases reinforce the central message about borrowed items not suiting the borrower, with specific mention of borrowed trousers (ṣòkòtò àgbàbọ̀) as a tangible example that would resonate in everyday Yoruba life.

Final Answer:
The proverb ""À-wín-ná-wó ò yẹni; à-gbà-bọ̀-ọ ṣòkòtò ò yẹ ọmọ èèyàn; bí kò fúnni lẹ́sẹ̀ a dòrògí; oh"

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""A ò mọ ohun tí Dárò-ó ní kó tó wí pé olè-é kó òun"" translates roughly to ""We don't know what Daro said before claiming that he was robbed.""
2. This suggests the proverb is about someone (Dáàró) who claims to be a victim (of theft) but we don't know the full story or what preceded this claim.
3. The phrase implies skepticism about someone's account of events - specifically questioning what happened before they made their accusation or claim.

Interim Insight: This proverb appears to be about questioning the credibility of someone's claims, particularly when they present themselves as a victim without providing context of what happened before.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""What did Daaro say before claiming that he was robbed?""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The second phrase about the tortoise (Àjàpá) translates approximately to ""The tortoise says nothing is like what we already know how to do; he says if he puts an egg in his mouth, he will spit out palm kernel.""
2. This Yoruba phrase illustrates how someone might make implausible claims about their abilities or experiences.
3. The tortoise is a common character in Yoruba folktales who often represents cunning, deception, and making false claims.
4. This connects to the Daaro proverb by highlighting how people may make dubious claims without evidence or logical background.

Interim Insight: Both phrases deal with credibility and the gap between claims and reality. The tortoise example reinforces that the Daaro proverb is about questioning suspicious claims that don't align with what we know to be possible or true.

## Final Synthesis:
- **Final Translation:** ""What did Daaro say before claiming that he was robbed?""

- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb encourages critical thinking and skepticism toward one-sided accounts. It suggests we should question what preceded someone's claim of victimhood, as they may have omitted important context that changes how we interpret the situation. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would be invoked when someone appears to be presenting themselves as a victim while potentially hiding their own role or provocation in the matter. It warns against accepting accusations at face value without understanding the full sequence of events.

- **References:** The first similar phrase reinforces the proverb's skepticism about incomplete narratives. The second phrase about the tortoise connects to Yoruba oral traditions where the tortoise (Àjàpá) frequently makes implausible claims, teaching listeners to question extraordinary claims that lack supporting evidence."

(What can the head do that the shoulders cannot? The shoulders carry loads worth five hundred, while the head sells its own for just twenty.)

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This similar phrase uses body parts (head and shoulders) to discuss relative value and capabilities.
2. It highlights how one might undervalue their own contributions while overvaluing others.
3. The numerical comparison (five hundred vs. twenty) creates a stark contrast to illustrate misperception of value.
4. This suggests our target proverb may similarly involve numerical comparisons and questioning of values or choices.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our target proverb likely contains a rhetorical question that exposes a contradiction or poor judgment in comparing values.

(Only a fool says there is no one like him; his kind are more than thousands upon thousands.)

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. This phrase cautions against thinking oneself unique or exceptional when in reality, one is quite ordinary.
2. It highlights the folly of self-importance and exaggerated self-assessment.
3. The phrase uses hyperbole (thousands upon thousands) to emphasize the commonness of supposedly unique traits.
4. Applied to our target proverb, this suggests questioning hypothetical gains when you haven't secured anything tangible yet.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase reinforces that our target proverb likely criticizes counting or valuing something before it's actually obtained, showing presumptuous or foolish thinking.

## Final Synthesis:
- **Final Translation:** ""The hunter going hunting asks, 'Should I hunt five hundred game or six hundred game?' But which one have you actually caught yet?""

- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This proverb ridicules those who debate potential future gains or hypothetical choices when they haven't accomplished anything concrete yet. It criticizes counting one's chickens before they hatch. In Yoruba culture, it warns against premature celebration or planning based on presumed success. The hunter who hasn't caught anything yet is foolishly debating how many animals to catch, showing poor judgment and misplaced priorities. The proverb teaches pragmatism and focusing on actual achievements rather than hypothetical scenarios.

- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 demonstrates the theme of misplaced values and incorrect self-assessment. Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the critique of foolish thinking and exaggerated self-importance that appears in the main proverb."

2. ""Ojú pọ́n"" refers to a state of hunger, desperation, or being in dire straits. In both proverbs, it suggests a threshold that shouldn't be crossed despite difficult circumstances.
3. The babaláwo (diviner) in the similar phrase occupies a position of respect, similar to the ""baálé"" (head of household) in our target proverb.
4. Both proverbs seem to address maintaining one's dignity and proper role despite hardship.

Interim Insight: The proverb likely addresses the importance of maintaining dignity and proper social roles even in difficult times. There are certain actions that would be beneath one's status regardless of desperation.

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining social hierarchy and dignity regardless of circumstances. In traditional Yoruba society, the head of the household (baálé) holds a position of respect and authority. Certain menial tasks like sweeping would typically be done by others in the household. The proverb teaches that even in difficult times, one should maintain dignity appropriate to one's station. It speaks to the broader cultural value of preserving social order and the proper roles assigned to different members of society. The proverb cautions against compromising one's status and dignity even when facing hardship.

- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces this by showing how a diviner (another respected position) maintains dignity despite hunger. Similar Phrase 2 uses animal imagery to show how creatures maintain their natural position in the hierarchy of life regardless of difficulties.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Ojú kì í pọ́n baálé ilé kó fọwọ́ gbálẹ̀ ilé ẹ̀"" translates to ""The head of the household won't be so desperate or hungry that he sweeps his own house with his hands.""

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Àì-kúkú-joye, ó sàn ju, 'Ẹnuù mi ò ká ìlú' lọ"" translates roughly to ""Not having had the opportunity to rule at all is better than saying 'My voice couldn't control the town'"" 
2. This speaks to the importance of social responsibilities and roles within Yoruba culture - it's better not to have a position than to fail at it
3. This relates to the main proverb which seems to discuss proper greetings based on social roles and positions

Interim Insight: Both proverbs deal with social protocols and appropriate behavior based on one's position in society, emphasizing the importance of knowing and fulfilling one's social obligations.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""Good day household"" is not appropriate for household members; ""Welcome visitor"" is not appropriate for someone who is coming as a visitor; one who doesn't greet appropriately with ""Welcome visitor"" will lose the ""Good day household"" greeting.

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The phrase ""Ibi tí a ti mú ọ̀lẹ ò kúnná; ibi tí a ti mú alágbáraá tó oko-ó ro"" translates roughly to ""Where a lazy person is caught doesn't require gathering firewood; where a strong person is caught requires tying them to a farm""

3. It reinforces the idea in the main proverb that different greetings are appropriate for different people based on their status or relationship

Interim Insight: The similar phrase reinforces the importance of context-appropriate behavior in Yoruba culture - different situations call for different protocols, just as different people should receive different greetings.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""Household members don't greet each other with 'Good day household'; visitors aren't greeted with 'Welcome visitor'; whoever doesn't properly greet others with 'Welcome visitor' will lose receiving the 'Good day household' greeting.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb teaches about the importance of proper greetings and social etiquette in Yoruba culture. It highlights that appropriate greetings should be given based on one's status and relationship. Household members don't need to greet each other as if they were visitors to their own home, and visitors shouldn't be greeted as if they lived there. The deeper meaning is that if you don't acknowledge others properly according to their status, you will lose the respect and acknowledgment due to your own status. In Yoruba culture, greetings are not merely pleasantries but important social indicators that reinforce community bonds and respect hierarchies.

- References: The first similar phrase emphasizes the importance of fulfilling social roles properly, while the second phrase reinforces that different contexts require different approaches - both supporting the main proverb's teaching about proper social etiquette.

Final Answer: This Yoruba proverb teaches that proper greetings based on social context are essential. It literally means that household members don't greet each other as visitors and vice versa, but its deeper meaning is that failing to acknowledge others properly will result in losing the acknowledgment due to yourself. In Yoruba culture, appropriate greetings are crucial social protocols that maintain harmony and respect in communities."

4. There's a cultural warning against false appearances or deceptive presentations.

Interim Insight: This second phrase suggests the main proverb might involve irony, particularly around something presenting itself as what it is not, similar to the frog with shoes in the original proverb.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""What meat have we not eaten before? The frog met us wearing shoes and ended up as a mess (or food).""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb uses humor and irony to convey wisdom about pretentiousness and natural consequences. The imagery of a frog wearing shoes represents something attempting to be what it is not naturally meant to be. The proverb suggests that people who try to present themselves as something they're not will eventually be exposed or ""end up in a mess."" It also conveys the Yoruba cultural value of authenticity and accepting one's true nature. The question ""What meat have we not eaten before?"" implies experienced wisdom - someone who has seen many unusual situations and isn't easily fooled by false appearances. Overall, it's a warning against pretension and a reminder that attempting to operate outside one's natural capabilities often leads to unfortunate consequences.

- References: The first similar phrase reinforces the pragmatic approach to life's situations, while the second similar phrase highlights the theme of irony regarding false presentations or claims.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Ẹran kí la ò jẹ rí? Ọ̀pọ̀lọ́ báni lábàtà ó ba búrúbúrú"" translates to ""What meat have we not eaten before? The frog met us wearing shoes and ended up as a mess."" It's a humorous warning against pretentiousness, suggesting that those who try to be what they're not will face unfortunate consequences. In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb encourages authenticity while cautioning against false appearances, using the absurd image of a shoe-wearing frog to illustrate how unnatural behaviors often lead to downfall."

2. This phrase suggests an ironic situation where unsuitable people present themselves for important responsibilities.
3. Both phrases use a structure that sets up a relationship between two types of people.
4. There's an underlying theme of mismatched capabilities and responsibilities.

2. This phrase criticizes those who make big shows or noise despite lacking capability.

Interim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces that our proverb is about the irony of situations where those least suited for a task (due to their excessive anger) are the ones taking responsibility for others (who are less angry).

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The one who gets excessively angry provides food for the one who gets mildly angry.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the irony where someone with poor emotional control (the excessively angry person) somehow becomes responsible for taking care of someone with better emotional control (the mildly angry person). It speaks to situations where roles are reversed inappropriately - those who need guidance themselves are attempting to guide others. In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to criticize situations where authority or responsibility is given to those who lack the temperament or capability to handle it properly, similar to putting an unstable person in charge of caring for others.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that the main proverb might involve someone attempting something beyond their capability or making claims they cannot fulfill.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""The petty/trivial actions of an Ijesa person, it hurts someone but isn't serious/expensive.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The second similar phrase ""Àgbààgbà ìlú ò lè péjọ kí wọn ó jẹ ìfun òkété, àfi iyán àná"" translates approximately to ""The elders of the town cannot gather to eat the intestines of a bush rat, only yesterday's pounded yam.""
2. This proverb speaks to appropriateness, dignity, and what is worthy of attention from important people.
3. It suggests that some matters are too trivial or undignified for serious attention.

Interim Insight: This reinforces the idea that the main proverb likely deals with triviality or insignificance - actions that might appear to have impact but are ultimately inconsequential.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""The petty actions of an Ijesa person may seem to hurt but aren't significant.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to situations where someone's actions or words might seem offensive or harmful on the surface, but ultimately lack substance or significance. It characterizes these actions as ""pẹ̀tẹ̀pẹ́tẹ̀"" (trivial or petty) and associates them with Ijesa people, suggesting a cultural stereotype about that subgroup. The proverb teaches discernment - the ability to distinguish between genuine threats or insults and those that are merely superficial. It encourages people not to overreact to minor provocations or to be overly concerned with trivial matters that may sting momentarily but cause no lasting harm.

- References: Both similar phrases reinforce the theme of distinguishing between appearance and reality. The first phrase shows the folly of exaggerated claims (like the main proverb's characterization of actions that seem harmful but aren't serious), while the second emphasizes the importance of not treating trivial matters with undue significance.

Final Answer: The proverb ""Pẹ̀tẹ̀pẹ́tẹ̀ Ìjèṣà, ó ta sẹ́ni lára kò wọ́n"" translates to ""The petty actions of an Ijesa person may seem to hurt but aren't significant."" It teaches that some provocations or offenses may sting momentarily but lack real consequence or lasting impact. The proverb encourages wisdom in distinguishing between genuine threats and mere annoyances, suggesting that not everything that appears harmful deserves a serious response."

### Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""Ta ní ńjájá ní mọ́ṣáláṣí?"" translates roughly to ""Who says the dog knows the mosque?"" This is questioning who claims a dog understands sacred spaces.
2. This phrase, like our proverb, uses a dog (ajá) as a central figure and questions someone's understanding or behavior in relation to established norms.
3. Both phrases use the interrogative structure ""Ta ní..."" (Who says/Who is...) to challenge an assumption.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely questions inappropriate behavior or misunderstanding of proper roles, using the dog as a metaphor for someone who doesn't understand proper boundaries or behaviors.

2. This phrase emphasizes how behavior reveals one's true nature and identity in Yoruba culture.
3. Applied to our proverb, it suggests that the act of eating while a dog stares hungrily reveals something about one's character - specifically, a lack of compassion or consideration.

### Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""Who eats while a dog watches hungrily?""
- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes selfishness and insensitivity. In Yoruba culture, sharing food is a fundamental value that demonstrates good character. The proverb uses the imagery of someone eating while a hungry dog looks on longingly to illustrate callousness. It serves as a rhetorical question highlighting the impropriety of enjoying abundance while ignoring others in need. The dog represents any dependent or less fortunate person whose needs are being ignored. This proverb teaches the importance of compassion, sharing resources, and being mindful of others' suffering.
- References: Similar Phrase 1 contributes the dog imagery and questioning structure; Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of character judgment.

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""Ta ní ńjẹun tájá ńjùrù?"" translates to ""Who eats while a dog watches hungrily?"" It criticizes selfishness and lack of compassion by questioning who would be insensitive enough to eat without sharing while someone else (represented by the dog) is obviously hungry. In Yoruba culture, this proverb teaches the moral importance of generosity, sharing, and being attentive to others' needs."

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb observes how people's preferences and choices reflect their fundamental character. The fastidious or elegant person (afínjú) chooses iwọ, a vegetable that requires careful preparation. The wise or knowledgeable person (ọ̀mọ̀ràn) favors kola nut, which is associated with wisdom, ritual, and thoughtful social interaction in Yoruba culture. The impulsive or hasty person (màrí-màjẹ) prefers alligator pepper, which provides immediate, strong sensation. The proverb teaches that our choices reveal our character, and different personalities naturally gravitate toward different things that suit their nature.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""If one refuses to learn from the lessons being taught, one is destined to suffer repeatedly.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of heeding wisdom and instruction. In Yoruba culture, learning often comes through observation, listening to elders, and sometimes through difficult experiences.

It reflects the Yoruba value of wisdom acquisition and respect for knowledge. The proverb serves both as a caution to the stubborn and as consolation to those enduring hardship while learning important life lessons.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The similar phrase ""A kì í kórira ọ̀fọ́n-ọ̀n ká finá bọ ahéré"" translates roughly to ""One does not hate the harmattan season so much that one sets fire to one's hut."" This suggests a warning against extreme reactions.
2. Both phrases mention ""ọ̀fọ́n-ọ̀n"" (harmattan), the dry, dusty season in West Africa characterized by harsh conditions.
3. The main proverb seems to reference making sacrifices to deities (òrìṣà) during harmattan, suggesting timing or circumstances matter.

Interim Insight: The similar phrase warns against self-destructive reactions to difficult seasons, suggesting our main proverb may also caution against inappropriate timing or excessive actions during challenging periods.

## Step 2 – Literal Translation
Translation: ""One does not worship/sacrifice to a deity during harmattan; if it reaches the ground, it will scatter everywhere.""

## Step 4 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2
Chain-of-Thought:
1. ""Olómele kì í sọ pé igi yó dàá lóde lọ́la"" translates to ""The woodcutter doesn't predict that wood will be scarce in the market tomorrow.""
2. This phrase suggests one shouldn't predict scarcity or future difficulties in one's own area of expertise or responsibility.
3. It carries the notion of not speaking against one's own interests or creating problems through pessimistic predictions.

Interim Insight: This adds the dimension of strategic timing and foresight - just as a woodcutter shouldn't predict wood scarcity (potentially harming his livelihood), one shouldn't perform important ritual actions during unfavorable conditions that would render them ineffective.

## Final Synthesis:
- **Final Translation:** ""One does not sacrifice to a deity during the harmattan season; if the offering reaches the ground, it will scatter everywhere.""

- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb teaches the importance of appropriate timing and conditions for significant actions. The harmattan season brings dry, dusty winds that would scatter offerings placed for deities, rendering the sacrifice ineffective or disrespectful. At a deeper level, it advises against pursuing important endeavors during unpropitious times. Just as one wouldn't destroy their home because of harsh weather (Similar Phrase 1), nor should one perform sacred duties when conditions will undermine them. And like the woodcutter who doesn't predict scarcity in his own market (Similar Phrase 2), one should be strategic about when to act, recognizing when conditions are favorable for success rather than setting oneself up for failure. The proverb ultimately counsels patience and wisdom in timing important actions.

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb speaks to the multiple influences that shape a person's identity and values. The imagery of powerful wild animals (leopard, civet cat) raising and adopting someone born into a human clan suggests diverse and formidable influences on one's upbringing. The final clause about refusing to eat soup without meat symbolizes unwavering loyalty to one's upbringing and formative influences - the person will not compromise on the core values instilled by their various ""guardians.""

It speaks to how a person's identity is shaped by diverse influences (family, community, mentors) while emphasizing unwavering loyalty to the core values these influences instill. The person remains committed to their principles and refuses to compromise on what they've been taught to value, just as they would refuse soup without meat.

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""Even when fully satiated, even when eating with abandon, using all ten fingers to eat is not befitting of a human being.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining proper etiquette and dignity regardless of circumstances. In Yoruba culture, eating with restraint and proper manners distinguishes humans from animals and demonstrates good upbringing and character. The proverb cautions against losing one's composure and civilized behavior even when extremely hungry or in informal settings. It teaches that while satisfying natural urges is necessary, how one does so reveals their true character and upbringing. This reflects the Yoruba emphasis on ìwà (character) and ẹ̀kọ́ (training/education) as markers of a well-formed person.

- References: The dog lapping water gradually (Similar Phrase 1) and the critique of mindless eating (Similar Phrase 2) both reinforce that there are proper ways to satisfy needs that preserve human dignity.

2. This phrase speaks to ingratitude and entitlement - complaining about imperfect gifts while not acknowledging one's true situation.
3. This adds depth to our original proverb by suggesting it's about people who demand special treatment or recognition in situations where they don't deserve it.
4. Both proverbs employ rhetorical questions to challenge someone's perspective.

Interim Insight: The proverb uses darkness as a metaphor for impartial forces that don't care about human status, and mocks those who still demand special recognition in such circumstances.

- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb teaches that certain forces and situations in life (symbolized by darkness) are impartial and do not respect human hierarchies, status, or wealth. It mocks those who expect special treatment in circumstances where everyone is treated equally. The proverb serves as a humbling reminder that nature and many of life's circumstances do not discriminate based on who we think we are - challenging human arrogance and entitlement. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would be used to caution someone against expecting preferential treatment in situations where everyone faces the same challenges.

- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of darkness as an equalizing force that ignores status. Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of entitlement and ingratitude that makes the cautionary message of the original proverb clearer."

## Final Synthesis:
- Final Translation: ""When a wife becomes too familiar or defiant with her husband, the mediator withdraws.""

It suggests that when a wife feels comfortable enough to challenge her husband or shows disrespect, outside mediators should recognize this as a sign to step back. The proverb acknowledges that every marriage develops its own internal dynamics and communication patterns that outsiders may not fully understand. Even when these dynamics appear problematic to outside observers, intervention may be inappropriate or unwelcome. The proverb counsels wisdom in knowing when to involve oneself in others' affairs, particularly in intimate relationships where complex dynamics are at play.

Similar Phrase 1: Àkísà-á mọ ìwọ̀n ara-a rẹ̀, ó gbé párá jẹ́.

## Step 1 – Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1
Chain-of-Thought:
1. The phrase ""Àkísà-á mọ ìwọ̀n ara-a rẹ̀, ó gbé párá jẹ́"" translates to ""The rag knows its limits/capacity, it carries dried stockfish."" This implies someone knowing their limitations but still taking on more than they can handle.
2. The imagery here is about someone of limited capacity (like a rag) attempting to carry something valuable (dried fish), which will likely result in the fish being ruined or spoiled.
3. There's a connection to our main proverb through the concept of ""gbé"" (carrying) and ""jẹ́"" (ruining/spoiling).

In Yoruba culture, social hierarchy and proper timing for advancement are highly valued. The proverb teaches that when someone is promoted too quickly, given undue praise, or placed in a position they haven't earned or aren't prepared for, they will likely make mistakes that lead to their own downfall. It counsels humility and the importance of gradual, earned advancement rather than seeking shortcuts to positions of honor or responsibility.

- Final Translation: ""One who looks down will find their nose.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that self-reflection leads to self-discovery. Just as your nose is always in your field of vision but you may not notice it until you consciously look down, the solutions to problems or self-knowledge are often already within your reach. The proverb encourages introspection and suggests that many answers we seek externally are actually part of us already. It also carries the subtle message that one doesn't need to search far and wide for something that is inherently part of oneself. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the value placed on self-awareness and recognizing one's own capabilities rather than making excuses (as reflected in Similar Phrase 1) or seeking external validation when the truth is already evident (as reflected in Similar Phrase 2).

- References: The interpretation is informed by Similar Phrase 1 which warns against making excuses, and Similar Phrase 2 which emphasizes how direct observation reveals truth.

Final Answer: The Yoruba proverb ""Ẹní bá dẹ ojú-u rẹ̀ sílẹ̀ á rímú-u rẹ̀"" translates to ""One who looks down will find their nose.""

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches about business wisdom and delayed gratification. It suggests that sometimes allowing resources or investments to accumulate without demanding immediate returns creates opportunities for greater future benefits. In traditional Yoruba economy, beads were valuable commodities that required craftsmanship to arrange. The proverb counsels patience in business dealings - demanding immediate payment might satisfy short-term needs but could prevent larger long-term benefits that come from allowing business relationships to develop naturally. It emphasizes the wisdom of strategic patience and investment rather than immediate profit-taking.

- References: The first similar phrase warns against exploitative relationships, while the second reinforces the natural order of self-interest in transactions. Together they frame the proverb as guidance about balanced and far-sighted economic relationships in Yoruba culture."

- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that hardship and suffering don't usually happen by chance but are often the consequences of one's choices, behaviors, or presentation. The proverb specifically emphasizes that if you present yourself as poor or destitute (whether through appearance, behavior, or mindset), society will treat you accordingly - serving you water with any calabash rather than with honor or respect. In Yoruba culture, how one is served water (and in what vessel) indicates their social standing. The proverb warns against self-neglect and encourages people to carry themselves with dignity, as your self-presentation significantly influences how others treat you. It also contains wisdom about taking responsibility for one's circumstances rather than blaming external factors.

In Yoruba traditional belief, different deities govern different domains and times, and respecting these boundaries shows wisdom.

It's similar to saying ""there's a time and place for everything.""

RAG,GPT,Ojú ò rọ́lá rí; ó bímọ ẹ̀ ó sọ ọ́ ní Ọláníyọnu.,A person only newly acquainted with wealth; he has a son and names him Ọlaniyọnu.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ojú ò rọ́lá rí; ó bímọ ẹ̀ ó sọ ọ́ ní Ọláníyọnu"" can be translated to English as ""The face has not seen wealth; it gave birth to a child and named it 'Wealth is troublesome'.""

Explanation:
This proverb speaks to the idea that someone who has never experienced wealth or prosperity might have a negative perception of it. The name ""Ọláníyọnu"" translates to ""Wealth is troublesome"" or ""Wealth brings problems."" The proverb suggests that because the person has never encountered wealth, they might assume it brings more trouble than benefit, hence naming their child in a way that reflects this belief. It highlights the notion that people often fear or misunderstand what they have not experienced themselves."
RAG,GPT,Ìwọ̀n eku nìwọ̀n ìtẹ́; olongo kì í gbé tìmùtìmù.,The measure of the rat is the measure of the nest; a robin does not live on a cushion.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ìwọ̀n eku nìwọ̀n ìtẹ́; olongo kì í gbé tìmùtìmù"" can be translated to English as ""The size of the rat determines the size of the hole; a wise person does not live recklessly.""

**Explanation:**

1. **Ìwọ̀n eku nìwọ̀n ìtẹ́ (The size of the rat determines the size of the hole):** This part of the proverb suggests that there is a natural balance or proportion between things. Just as a rat will only fit into a hole that matches its size, situations and actions should be appropriate and proportional to the circumstances.

2. **Olongo kì í gbé tìmùtìmù (A wise person does not live recklessly):** This part emphasizes the importance of wisdom and caution in one's actions. A wise person is expected to act with consideration and not engage in reckless or thoughtless behavior.

Overall, the proverb advises that one should act in accordance with their circumstances and capabilities, and exercise wisdom and caution in their actions. It highlights the importance of balance, appropriateness, and prudence in life."
RAG,GPT,"Ẹyẹ tó fi ara wé igún, ẹ̀hìn àdìrò ní ńsùn.",Whatever bird emulates the vulture will find itself behind the cooking hearth.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ẹyẹ tó fi ara wé igún, ẹ̀hìn àdìrò ní ńsùn"" translates to ""The bird that compares itself to the vulture sleeps behind the kitchen."" 

Explanation: In Yoruba culture, the vulture is often seen as a bird that can endure harsh conditions and survive in difficult environments. The proverb suggests that when someone tries to imitate or compare themselves to someone else without having the same capabilities or resilience, they may end up in unfavorable or uncomfortable situations. In this context, ""sleeping behind the kitchen"" implies being in a less desirable or inferior position. The proverb serves as a caution against comparing oneself to others without understanding their unique strengths or circumstances."
RAG,GPT,Àwúrèbeé ní òún lè yẹ̀nà; ta ní jẹ́ tọ ọ̀nà àwúrèbe?,Àwúrebe says it can make a path; who would wish to follow a path it makes?,"The Yoruba proverb ""Àwúrèbeé ní òún lè yẹ̀nà; ta ní jẹ́ tọ ọ̀nà àwúrèbe?"" can be translated to English as ""The chameleon claims it can navigate the path; who has ever walked the path of a chameleon?""

Explanation:
This proverb uses the chameleon, known for its unique ability to change colors and adapt to its surroundings, as a metaphor. The chameleon claims it can navigate its path, but the question posed is who has ever walked the path of a chameleon. This suggests that the chameleon's path is unique and not easily understood or followed by others.

The proverb is often used to highlight the idea that some individuals or situations are unique and cannot be easily imitated or comprehended by others. It emphasizes the distinctiveness of certain experiences or abilities, suggesting that what works for one may not necessarily work for another. It can also imply that some people have a unique way of handling situations that others might find difficult to replicate."

Explanation:
This proverb emphasizes the importance of self-reliance and independence. It advises against depending too much on others, whether they are familiar (the host) or unfamiliar (the guest). Instead, it suggests that one should rely on their own abilities and resources. The proverb teaches the value of self-sufficiency and encourages individuals to take responsibility for their own well-being and success."
RAG,GPT,Eégún ju eégún; òrìṣá ju òrìṣà; Pààká lé oníṣàngó wọ̀gbẹ́.,Some masqueraders are greater than others; some gods are greater than others; the masquerader Pààká chases the Ṣàngó worshipper into the bush.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Eégún ju eégún; òrìṣá ju òrìṣà; Pààká lé oníṣàngó wọ̀gbẹ́"" can be translated to English as ""Masquerade surpasses masquerade; deity surpasses deity; Pààká (a type of masquerade) overpowers the Sango worshipper.""

Explanation:
This proverb highlights the concept of hierarchy and superiority within similar categories. It suggests that within any group or category, there are always individuals or entities that are superior to others. The proverb uses the imagery of masquerades (eégún) and deities (òrìṣá) to illustrate this point. In Yoruba culture, masquerades and deities are significant, and there are different levels of power and influence among them. The mention of ""Pààká"" and ""oníṣàngó"" (Sango worshipper) further emphasizes the idea that even among powerful entities, there are those that are more dominant or influential. This proverb can be applied to various aspects of life, reminding us that there is always someone or something greater, and it encourages humility and recognition of hierarchy."
RAG,GPT,"“Mo yó” ńjẹ́ “mo yó,” “mo kọ̀” ńjẹ́ “mo kọ̀”; jẹun ǹṣó, àgbà ọ̀kánjúwà ni.","“I am full” means “I am full”; “I decline” means “I decline”; eating with abandon, that is the father of all greediness.","The Yoruba proverb “Mo yó” ńjẹ́ “mo yó,” “mo kọ̀” ńjẹ́ “mo kọ̀”; jẹun ǹṣó, àgbà ọ̀kánjúwà ni” can be translated to English as: ""‘I am full’ means ‘I am full,’ ‘I am not full’ means ‘I am not full’; eating excessively is the mark of a greedy elder.""

Explanation:
This proverb highlights the importance of moderation and self-awareness, especially in the context of eating. It suggests that when someone says they are full, they should mean it, and when they say they are not full, it should also be true. The proverb criticizes excessive eating, particularly in elders, as a sign of greed. It emphasizes the value of honesty and self-control, implying that a wise person knows when to stop and does not indulge beyond their needs."
RAG,GPT,Àgbàlagbà kì í wẹwọ́ tán kó ní òun ó jẹ si.,An elder does not wash his hand and then decide to eat more.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Àgbàlagbà kì í wẹwọ́ tán kó ní òun ó jẹ si"" translates to ""An elder does not finish eating and then say they will eat more."" 

This proverb emphasizes the wisdom and self-restraint expected of elders. It suggests that a person of maturity and experience should know their limits and not overindulge or be greedy. It also implies that elders should set an example of moderation and contentment for younger generations. The proverb can be applied more broadly to encourage people to be satisfied with what they have and to avoid excessive desires or actions."
RAG,GPT,Ẹni à bá tà ká fowó-o rẹ̀ ra àdá: ó ní ìyà àdá ńjẹ òun.,A person who should be sold for money to purchase a machete bemoans his lack of a machete.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ẹni à bá tà ká fowó-o rẹ̀ ra àdá: ó ní ìyà àdá ńjẹ òun"" translates to ""The person we sell to and use the money to buy a cutlass: he says the suffering of the cutlass is affecting him.""

Explanation:
This proverb is used to describe a situation where someone complains about the consequences of their own choices or actions. In this context, the person has been sold (metaphorically) and the proceeds used to buy a cutlass, which is a tool associated with hard work and labor. The person then complains about the hardship or suffering that comes with using the cutlass. It highlights the irony of someone lamenting the difficulties that arise from a situation they are directly responsible for or have contributed to. Essentially, it is a commentary on taking responsibility for one's actions and the outcomes they produce."
RAG,GPT,"Kàkà ká dọ̀bálẹ̀ fún Gàm̀bàrí, ká rọ́jú ká kú.","Rather than prostrate oneself in homage or obeisance to a Hausa person, one should rather die.","The Yoruba proverb ""Kàkà ká dọ̀bálẹ̀ fún Gàm̀bàrí, ká rọ́jú ká kú"" can be translated to English as ""Instead of bowing down to a Fulani, we would rather endure and die.""

This proverb emphasizes the value of dignity and self-respect over submission or humiliation. In this context, ""Gàm̀bàrí"" refers to the Fulani people, who are traditionally seen as outsiders or conquerors in some Yoruba narratives. The proverb suggests that it is better to endure hardship or even face death than to compromise one's principles or self-respect by submitting to someone perceived as an oppressor or someone who does not have one's best interests at heart. It highlights the importance of maintaining one's integrity and standing firm in the face of adversity."
RAG,GPT,À-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa ẹmọ́n; à-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa àfè; à-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa máláàjú.,Feeding-without-leaving kills the Tullberg's rat; feeding-without-departing kills the spotted grass mouse; feeding-without-departing kills the máláàjú rat.,"The Yoruba proverb ""À-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa ẹmọ́n; à-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa àfè; à-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa máláàjú"" can be translated to English as ""It is the inability to stop eating that kills the monkey; it is the inability to stop eating that kills the fly; it is the inability to stop eating that kills the antelope.""

This proverb highlights the dangers of excess and lack of moderation. It suggests that overindulgence or the inability to control one's desires can lead to one's downfall or demise. Each animal mentioned (the monkey, the fly, and the antelope) represents different aspects of life where excess can be harmful. The proverb serves as a warning to practice self-control and moderation in all aspects of life to avoid negative consequences."
RAG,GPT,"A kì í fi ìka ro etí, ká fi ro imú, ká wá tún fi ta ehín.","One does not use one's finger to clean one's ear passages, use it to pick one's nose, and then use it to pick one's teeth.","The Yoruba proverb ""A kì í fi ìka ro etí, ká fi ro imú, ká wá tún fi ta ehín"" translates to ""One does not scratch the ear with a finger, then use it to pick the nose, and then use it to pick the teeth.""

This proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining proper hygiene and orderliness in one's actions. It suggests that there is a correct and appropriate way to do things, and mixing up actions or using the same tool for different purposes can lead to undesirable outcomes.

RAG,GPT,"Ṣàkì ńṣe bí ọ̀rá, egungun ńṣe bí ẹran.",The tripe presents itself as fat; the bone presents itself as meat.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ṣàkì ńṣe bí ọ̀rá, egungun ńṣe bí ẹran"" can be translated to English as ""The sack behaves like a bag, the skeleton behaves like meat.""

This proverb uses metaphorical language to convey a message about appearances and reality. A ""ṣàkì"" (sack) and ""ọ̀rá"" (bag) may seem similar in function, but they are different in quality and purpose. Similarly, ""egungun"" (skeleton) and ""ẹran"" (meat) may appear similar in form, but they are fundamentally different in substance.

The proverb suggests that things or people may appear similar on the surface, but they can be quite different in essence or value. It serves as a reminder not to judge based solely on appearances, as the true nature or quality of something may be hidden beneath the surface."

Explanation: This proverb conveys the idea that arrogance or disrespect, especially towards those in authority or elders, often leads to negative consequences or disgrace. It serves as a warning against being presumptuous or disrespectful, suggesting that such behavior will eventually lead to an embarrassing or humbling situation. The proverb emphasizes the importance of humility and respect in social interactions."
RAG,GPT,Àgbàlagbà tí ò kí Ààrẹ ńfi okùn sin ara-a rẹ̀.,An elder who does not greet the Ààrẹ tries a “hanging” rope for size.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Àgbàlagbà tí ò kí Ààrẹ ńfi okùn sin ara-a rẹ̀"" translates to ""An elder who does not greet the chief is tying a rope around his own neck.""

Explanation: In Yoruba culture, greeting is a significant aspect of showing respect, especially towards those in positions of authority or elders. The proverb suggests that an elder who fails to show respect to a leader or someone of higher status is essentially bringing trouble upon themselves. It implies that neglecting to observe social norms and courtesies can lead to negative consequences, as it may be perceived as disrespectful or rebellious. The imagery of ""tying a rope around one's own neck"" emphasizes the self-destructive nature of such behavior."
RAG,GPT,"Àì-lápá làdá ò mú; bí a bá lápá, ọmọ owú to-o gégi.",It is a deficiency of biceps that blunts the machete; if one has strong biceps one can cut trees with a cudgel.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Àì-lápá làdá ò mú; bí a bá lápá, ọmọ owú to-o gégi"" can be translated to English as ""A cutlass does not cut without strength; if one has strength, even a cotton child can cut a tree.""

Explanation:
This proverb emphasizes the importance of effort and strength in achieving tasks. The cutlass, a tool for cutting, is ineffective without the application of force or effort. Similarly, even someone perceived as weak or delicate (like a ""cotton child"") can accomplish significant tasks (like cutting a tree) if they apply themselves with strength and determination. The proverb teaches that success is not just about having the right tools or opportunities but also about the effort and energy one puts into using them."
RAG,GPT,Ibi tí a fi ara sí lara ńgbé.,"Wherever one situates the body, there it inhabits.","The Yoruba proverb ""Ibi tí a fi ara sí lara ńgbé"" translates to ""Where one places oneself is where one will find comfort"" or ""Where one situates oneself is where one will dwell."" 

This proverb emphasizes the idea of personal responsibility and the consequences of one's choices. It suggests that the situations or conditions we find ourselves in are often a result of our own decisions and actions. Therefore, it encourages individuals to be mindful of the choices they make, as these choices will determine their experiences and comfort in life. It highlights the importance of being deliberate and thoughtful about where and how we position ourselves in various aspects of life, whether it be in relationships, career, or personal development."
RAG,GPT,"Bí ìlàrí bá fẹ́ tẹ́, a ní kí lọba ó ṣe?","When a courtier seeks disgrace, he asks, “What can the king do?”","The Yoruba proverb ""Bí ìlàrí bá fẹ́ tẹ́, a ní kí lọba ó ṣe?"" translates to ""If a eunuch wants to procreate, what can the king do?"" in English.

Explanation:
This proverb is used to illustrate situations where someone desires something that is inherently impossible due to their circumstances or limitations. In this context, the eunuch, who is physically incapable of procreation, represents someone with an unattainable desire. The king, who is typically seen as powerful and capable of granting wishes, is powerless in this situation because the desire itself is beyond the realm of possibility. The proverb emphasizes the idea that some things are simply beyond anyone's control, regardless of their status or power."
RAG,GPT,Àfi ohun tí a kì í tà lọ́jà lẹrú kì í jẹ.,The only thing a slave cannot eat is something not available in the market.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Àfi ohun tí a kì í tà lọ́jà lẹrú kì í jẹ"" can be translated to English as ""A slave does not eat what is not sold in the market."" 

Explanation:
This proverb highlights the idea of limitations and boundaries, particularly in the context of social or economic status. It suggests that a person, especially one in a subordinate position (like a slave), is restricted to what is available or permissible within their environment or circumstances. In a broader sense, it can be interpreted to mean that people should not overstep their bounds or attempt to acquire things that are beyond their reach or not meant for them. It emphasizes the importance of understanding one's place and acting within the limits of one's role or situation."
RAG,GPT,Àṣá kì í rà kádìẹ gbé kòkòrò dání.,"When a kite hovers, a chicken does not hang on to an insect.","The Yoruba proverb ""Àṣá kì í rà kádìẹ gbé kòkòrò dání"" translates to ""The hawk does not carry the chick and leave the insect behind."" 

This proverb is used to convey the idea that when someone is intent on achieving a goal or obtaining something valuable, they will not settle for something of lesser value. In the context of the hawk, which is a bird of prey, it would naturally go for the more substantial and valuable prey (the chick) rather than something insignificant (the insect). 

The proverb is often used to emphasize the importance of prioritizing significant goals or objectives over trivial matters. It suggests that one should focus on what truly matters and not get distracted by less important things."
RAG,GPT,"Ká wí ogún, ká wí ọgbọ̀n, “Ng ò fẹ́, ng ò gbà” laṣiwèré fi ńpẹ̀kun ọ̀ràn.","Whether one speaks twenty times or speaks thirty times, “I do not like it, and I will not accept it” is how the imbecile ends the discussion.","The Yoruba proverb ""Ká wí ogún, ká wí ọgbọ̀n, “Ng ò fẹ́, ng ò gbà” laṣiwèré fi ńpẹ̀kun ọ̀ràn"" can be translated to English as: ""After discussing strategies and wisdom, 'I don't want, I won't accept' is how a mad person ends a matter.""

Explanation:
This proverb highlights the futility of trying to reason with someone who is irrational or unwilling to listen. It suggests that no matter how much wisdom or strategy is applied to a situation, if a person is not open to accepting advice or solutions, the effort is wasted. The use of ""laṣiwèré"" (a mad person) emphasizes the stubbornness or irrationality of such an individual, who ultimately dismisses all logical discourse with a simple refusal. The proverb serves as a reminder of the limitations of reasoning with someone who is not receptive to it."
RAG,GPT,Ẹni tí a fẹ́ yàtọ̀ sí ẹni tó ní kò sí irú òun.,A person one loves is different from a person who says there is no one like him/herself.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ẹni tí a fẹ́ yàtọ̀ sí ẹni tó ní kò sí irú òun"" can be translated to English as ""The person we love is different from the one who claims there is no one like them.""

Explanation:
This proverb highlights the distinction between genuine affection and self-centeredness. It suggests that the person who is truly loved is often humble and does not boast about their uniqueness or superiority. In contrast, someone who constantly claims that there is no one like them may not be as genuinely loved or appreciated. The proverb emphasizes the value of humility and the idea that true love is not about self-promotion but about genuine connection and appreciation."
RAG,GPT,Àgùnbánirọ̀ ní ńfojúdini.,It is the person taller than another who shows no respect for the other.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Àgùnbánirọ̀ ní ńfojúdini"" can be translated to English as ""The one who helps you to carry a burden is the one who looks you in the face."" 

Explanation: This proverb emphasizes the value of genuine support and assistance. It suggests that those who truly help you in times of need are the ones who are honest and straightforward with you. They are not afraid to look you in the eye because their intentions are sincere. It highlights the importance of recognizing and appreciating those who offer real support and stand by you, as opposed to those who may pretend to help but do not have your best interests at heart."
RAG,GPT,"Ìtàkùn tó tó ọ̀pẹ kò tó pé kérin má lọ; ìtàkùn tó pé kérin má lọ Àlọ́, tòun terin ní ńlọ.",A vine as thick as a palm-tree trunk will not stop an elephant; whatever vine attempts to stop an elephant from going to Alọ will go with the elephant instead.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ìtàkùn tó tó ọ̀pẹ kò tó pé kérin má lọ; ìtàkùn tó pé kérin má lọ Àlọ́, tòun terin ní ńlọ"" can be translated to English as: ""A rope tied to a palm tree is not strong enough to stop an elephant from moving; a rope that claims to stop an elephant from moving is only fooling itself, as the elephant will continue on its path.""

Explanation:
This proverb uses the imagery of a rope and an elephant to convey a message about the futility of trying to restrain or control something that is beyond one's capacity. The palm tree and the rope symbolize efforts or measures that are inadequate for the task at hand. The elephant represents a powerful force or situation that cannot be easily stopped or controlled. The proverb suggests that one should recognize the limits of their abilities and not overestimate their capacity to control or influence situations that are inherently beyond their control. It is a reminder to be realistic about one's capabilities and to avoid self-deception."
RAG,GPT,"Bí a bá ńgúnyán, kòmẹsẹ̀ á yọ.","If one prepares pounded yams, the uninvited should depart.","The Yoruba proverb ""Bí a bá ńgúnyán, kòmẹsẹ̀ á yọ"" translates to ""If we are pounding yam, the leg will get stained.""

In a broader sense, it suggests that engaging in any task or endeavor will naturally come with its own set of challenges or difficulties. It emphasizes the inevitability of facing some form of impact or consequence when you are actively involved in something."
RAG,GPT,Ọmọ àì-jọbẹ̀-rí tí ńja epo sáyà.,A child new to eating stews: he shows himself by dripping palm-oil on his chest.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ọmọ àì-jọbẹ̀-rí tí ńja epo sáyà"" translates to ""A child who has never tasted soup is scooping palm oil into their pocket.""

This proverb is used to describe someone who is inexperienced or naive, yet they are acting in a way that suggests they are knowledgeable or capable. It highlights the irony of someone who lacks understanding or experience trying to handle a situation that is beyond their grasp. The imagery of a child putting palm oil in their pocket suggests a lack of awareness of the consequences, as the oil will obviously stain and ruin the pocket, just as inexperience can lead to mistakes or problems."

It suggests that certain things, such as traits, responsibilities, or possessions, are passed down from parents to their children.

RAG,GPT,"Ó yẹ ẹni gbogbo kó dínwó aró, kò yẹ atọ̀ọ́lé.","It is fitting for everybody to bargain to reduce the cost of dyeing clothes, but not the bed wetter.","The Yoruba proverb ""Ó yẹ ẹni gbogbo kó dínwó aró, kò yẹ atọ̀ọ́lé"" can be translated to English as ""It is expected of everyone to limp a little, but not of the lazy person.""

Explanation:
This proverb highlights the idea that everyone faces challenges or difficulties in life, symbolized by ""limping."" It is normal and expected for people to encounter obstacles and to show signs of struggle. However, the proverb makes a distinction when it comes to a lazy person (""atọ̀ọ́lé""). For a lazy person, any sign of struggle or difficulty is not due to genuine effort or hardship but rather a result of their own lack of initiative or diligence. Essentially, the proverb suggests that while everyone may have their burdens, the lazy person cannot use this as an excuse for their lack of progress or success. It emphasizes the importance of effort and the difference between genuine challenges and those that arise from laziness."

This proverb conveys the idea that a single day of misfortune or a single event of damage is not enough to completely ruin or destroy an entire community or situation. It emphasizes resilience and the ability to recover from setbacks. The underlying message is that challenges or failures, no matter how significant they may seem at the moment, do not define the entirety of a situation or the future. There is always the possibility of rebuilding, healing, and moving forward."

Explanation:
This proverb advises caution and wisdom before engaging in disputes or conflicts over something that may not rightfully belong to us. It suggests that one should first ascertain the legitimacy or ownership of what is being contested before getting involved in any arguments or battles over it.

Explanation: This proverb highlights the importance of support and assistance within a community or family, especially when the leader or head of the household is facing difficulties.

The proverb emphasizes that in times of struggle, collective support and cooperation are crucial to overcoming challenges."

""A dandy enters the market walking elegantly, a rough person enters the market walking clumsily; it is the rough person who carries the dandy's load home.""

Explanation:

This proverb highlights the contrast between appearances and practical abilities. The ""dandy"" (afínjú) represents someone who is concerned with appearances and elegance, while the ""rough person"" (ọ̀bún) represents someone who may not be as concerned with appearances but is practical and capable. The proverb suggests that while the dandy may look impressive, it is the rough person who ends up doing the actual work or heavy lifting. It serves as a reminder that appearances can be deceiving and that true value often lies in practicality and capability rather than mere outward appearance."

Explanation:
This proverb uses the imagery of termites and ants, which are small and seemingly insignificant creatures, attempting to catch a runaway chicken, which is a task that seems beyond their capability. The phrase ""we shall see"" implies skepticism about their ability to achieve this goal. The proverb is often used to express doubt about someone's ability to accomplish a task that seems too ambitious or beyond their means. It serves as a reminder to be realistic about one's capabilities and to not overestimate one's power or influence."
RAG,GPT,Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ò mẹ̀yẹ.,A pig does not know what is becoming.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ò mẹ̀yẹ"" translates to ""The pig is not a bird"" in English. This proverb is used to convey the idea that certain things or people cannot change their inherent nature or characteristics. Just as a pig cannot become a bird, some things are fundamentally what they are, regardless of any attempts to alter or disguise them. It serves as a reminder to recognize and accept the true nature of things or people, rather than expecting them to be something they are not."

**Explanation:**

This proverb uses the imagery of an elephant, a symbol of great strength and determination, and a chain or rope, which represents constraints or limitations. The message conveyed is that certain forces or constraints are not strong enough to stop someone or something that is determined and powerful. It emphasizes the idea that true strength and determination cannot be easily hindered by external limitations or obstacles.

Explanation:
This proverb uses the imagery of a firefly, a small insect that emits light, claiming it can put out a lamp, which is a much larger and more powerful source of light. The message here is about overestimating one's abilities or taking on a task that is beyond one's capacity. It suggests that when someone attempts to do something beyond their power or capability, they are more likely to harm themselves or fail in the process. It serves as a caution against arrogance and encourages self-awareness and humility."
RAG,GPT,"Àgbàlagbà akàn tó kó sí garawa yègèdè, ojú tì í.",The elderly crab that enters into a bucket; it is thoroughly disgraced.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Àgbàlagbà akàn tó kó sí garawa yègèdè, ojú tì í"" can be translated to English as ""The old crab that is put into a wide-mouthed container is ashamed.""

Explanation:
This proverb uses the imagery of a crab, which is known for its sideways movement and difficulty in escaping from containers, to convey a deeper meaning about wisdom and experience. The ""old crab"" symbolizes an elder or someone with experience. The ""wide-mouthed container"" represents a situation that should be easy to navigate or escape from due to the elder's experience. However, if the elder finds themselves trapped or unable to handle the situation, it brings about a sense of shame or embarrassment.

The proverb highlights the expectation that with age and experience comes the ability to handle situations adeptly. When an elder fails to do so, it can be seen as a failure to live up to the wisdom and capability that is typically associated with age. It serves as a reminder of the importance of living up to one's experience and the potential embarrassment when one does not."
RAG,GPT,A pè ọ́ lọ́mọ erín-màgbọn ò ńyọ̀; ìwọ pàápàá ló mì í?,"You are described as the child of the elephant that swallows coconuts, and you rejoice; are you the one who swallows coconuts?","The Yoruba proverb ""A pè ọ́ lọ́mọ erín-màgbọn ò ńyọ̀; ìwọ pàápàá ló mì í?"" can be translated to English as ""We called you the child of a laughing animal, and you are not smiling; are you the one who should be frowning?""

This proverb is used to highlight a situation where someone is expected to be happy or cheerful due to their circumstances or the way they are perceived, but instead, they are not showing the expected emotion. It suggests that the person is not living up to the positive expectations or reputation associated with them. The proverb can be applied in situations where someone is expected to be joyful or content but is instead displaying dissatisfaction or unhappiness, prompting others to question why they are not meeting those expectations."
RAG,GPT,Olówó ní ḿbá ọlọ́rọ̀-ọ́ rìn; ẹgbẹ́ ní ḿbá ẹgbẹ́ ṣeré.,It is a rich person that keeps company with a wealthy person; only people of equal standing play together.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Olówó ní ḿbá ọlọ́rọ̀-ọ́ rìn; ẹgbẹ́ ní ḿbá ẹgbẹ́ ṣeré"" translates to ""The wealthy walk with the wealthy; like-minded people play together.""

In a broader sense, it reflects the idea that people are drawn to those with whom they have common ground, whether it be wealth, interests, or other attributes."

""Let the servant know themselves as a servant; let the apprentice know themselves as an apprentice; let a person of good character know themselves as a servant of the Almighty God.""

This proverb emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and understanding one's role or position in life. It suggests that individuals should recognize and accept their status or responsibilities, whether as a servant, an apprentice, or a person of integrity serving a higher power. By acknowledging and embracing their roles, people can act appropriately and fulfill their duties effectively. The proverb also highlights humility and the recognition of one's place in the larger scheme of things, particularly in relation to divine authority."
RAG,GPT,A kì í gbọ́n ju ẹni tí a máa dÍfá fún.,One cannot be wiser than the person for whom one will consult the Ifá oracle.,"The Yoruba proverb ""A kì í gbọ́n ju ẹni tí a máa dÍfá fún"" translates to ""One cannot be wiser than the person for whom Ifá is being consulted."" 

In Yoruba culture, Ifá is a system of divination and a key component of the Yoruba religion. It involves consulting the oracle to gain insight and guidance on various matters. The proverb suggests that no matter how wise or knowledgeable one may be, they cannot surpass the wisdom or insight that is specifically meant for the person receiving the divination. It emphasizes the idea that certain knowledge or guidance is uniquely tailored to an individual's situation, and it is not for others to claim or understand fully.

The proverb teaches humility and respect for the personal and unique nature of divine guidance. It reminds people that wisdom is not just about general knowledge but also about understanding and respecting the specific insights meant for others."
RAG,GPT,Kí ni wọ́n ti ńṣe Àmọ́dù nÍlọrin? Ewúrẹ́ ńjẹ́ bẹ́ẹ̀.,What use do the people of Ilorin have for Ahmadu? Even goats are so named.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Kí ni wọ́n ti ńṣe Àmọ́dù nÍlọrin? Ewúrẹ́ ńjẹ́ bẹ́ẹ̀."" translates to ""What are they doing to Àmọdù in Ilorin? A goat is eating it like that.""

This proverb is used to describe a situation where something is happening that seems unusual or unexpected, but it is actually quite normal or typical for the context. The mention of Àmọdù and Ilorin, along with the goat eating, suggests that what might seem strange or noteworthy to an outsider is actually a common occurrence in that setting. Essentially, it highlights the idea that what might be perceived as odd or noteworthy is just the usual way of things in that particular environment."
RAG,GPT,A-dá-má-lè-ṣe àdàbà tí ńdún bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀.,Start-something-it-cannot-finish dove that makes bombastic noises.,"The Yoruba proverb ""A-dá-má-lè-ṣe àdàbà tí ńdún bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀"" can be translated to English as ""One who claims to be gentle like a dove but makes a loud noise.""

### Explanation:
This proverb is used to describe someone who pretends to be gentle, calm, or harmless but whose actions or behavior contradict that appearance. The dove is often associated with peace and gentleness, and the sound ""bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀"" suggests a loud or disruptive noise, which is not characteristic of a dove. Therefore, the proverb highlights the inconsistency between one's claimed nature and their actual behavior, often pointing to hypocrisy or deceit. It serves as a caution against trusting appearances without considering actions."
RAG,GPT,A-lu-dùndún kì í dárin.,The dùndún player does not lead a song.,"The Yoruba proverb ""A-lu-dùndún kì í dárin"" can be translated to ""One who beats the dundun drum does not dance."" 

Explanation: In Yoruba culture, the dundun is a type of talking drum that is often used in musical performances. The proverb suggests that a person who is responsible for a particular task or role (in this case, playing the drum) cannot simultaneously engage in another activity that requires their full attention (such as dancing). It highlights the importance of focus and dedication to one's responsibilities. The broader implication is that one should concentrate on their primary duties and not get distracted by other activities that could compromise their effectiveness."
RAG,GPT,Aláṣọ-kan kì í ná ànárẹ.,A person who has only one set of clothing does not bargain until he is wet.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Aláṣọ-kan kì í ná ànárẹ"" translates to ""A person with only one cloth does not dance near the fire."" 

This proverb conveys the idea of being cautious and avoiding unnecessary risks, especially when one has limited resources or options. If someone has only one piece of clothing, they must be careful not to damage it, as they have no replacement. Similarly, in life, when resources or opportunities are scarce, it is wise to be prudent and avoid actions that could lead to loss or harm."
RAG,GPT,Ọjọ́ àgbà-á kú sàn ju ọjọ́ àgbà-á tẹ́.,The day an elder dies is far better than the day an elder is disgraced.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ọjọ́ àgbà-á kú sàn ju ọjọ́ àgbà-á tẹ́"" translates to ""The day an elder dies is better than the day an elder is disgraced."" 

This proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining dignity and respect throughout one's life. In Yoruba culture, elders are highly respected, and their wisdom and experience are valued. The proverb suggests that it is preferable for an elder to pass away with their honor intact rather than live to see a day when they are humiliated or lose their respect in the community. It underscores the value placed on honor and the legacy one leaves behind, highlighting that a dignified end is more honorable than a life that ends in disgrace."
RAG,GPT,Ẹyẹ ò lè rí omi inú àgbọn bù mu.,A bird cannot get at the liquid inside a coconut to drink.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ẹyẹ ò lè rí omi inú àgbọn bù mu"" translates to ""A bird cannot drink the water inside a coconut"" in English.

Explanation:
This proverb is used to convey the idea that certain things are beyond one's reach or capability, no matter how much one desires them. Just as a bird cannot access the water inside a coconut due to its hard shell, there are situations or goals that may be unattainable due to limitations or obstacles. It serves as a reminder to recognize and accept one's limitations and to focus on achievable goals."
RAG,GPT,“Mo mọ̀-ọ́ tán” lOrò-ó fi ńgbé ọkùnrin.,“I know it all” is the reason for Orò's carrying a man away.,"The Yoruba proverb ““Mo mọ̀-ọ́ tán” lOrò-ó fi ńgbé ọkùnrin” can be translated to English as “It is ‘I know it all’ that ruins a man.” 

Explanation:
This proverb highlights the dangers of arrogance and the false sense of complete knowledge. It suggests that when a person believes they know everything, they become closed off to learning and growth, which can lead to their downfall. The proverb serves as a caution against overconfidence and encourages humility and openness to new information and perspectives. It emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and the recognition that no one can truly know everything."
RAG,GPT,Nígbàtí à ńto ọkà a ò to ti ẹmọ́ si.,When we were stacking the corn we did not stack some for the brown rat.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Nígbàtí à ńto ọkà a ò to ti ẹmọ́ si"" translates to ""When we were arranging the corn, we did not arrange the guinea corn with it.""

This proverb is used to emphasize the importance of focusing on the task at hand and not mixing unrelated matters. It suggests that when dealing with a particular issue or project, one should concentrate on that specific matter without introducing irrelevant elements. The proverb highlights the value of organization and prioritization, ensuring that each task is handled appropriately without unnecessary distractions."
RAG,GPT,"Àbúrò rẹ ńdáṣọ fún ọ, o ní o ò lo elékuru; ta ní ńlo alákàrà?","Your junior brother (or sister) buys clothing for you, and you say you will not wear anything with bean-grits patterns; who has the right to opt for clothing with a bean-fritter patterns?","The Yoruba proverb ""Àbúrò rẹ ńdáṣọ fún ọ, o ní o ò lo elékuru; ta ní ńlo alákàrà?"" can be translated to English as: ""Your younger sibling is making clothes for you, and you say you don't wear rags; who then wears patched clothes?""

**Explanation:**

This proverb is a commentary on ingratitude and the failure to appreciate the efforts of others, especially when they are doing their best to help or support you. In the context of the proverb, the younger sibling is making clothes, which is an act of kindness and support. However, the person dismisses this effort by saying they don't wear rags, implying that the clothes made by the sibling are not good enough. The rhetorical question ""who then wears patched clothes?"" highlights the irony and ungratefulness of the situation, suggesting that if you cannot appreciate the effort of someone close to you, then who else will you appreciate?

The proverb teaches the importance of gratitude and recognizing the value in the efforts and contributions of others, even if they do not meet one's personal standards or expectations."
RAG,GPT,"Bí kò sí tọ̀bùn èèyàn, ta ni ìbá jí lówùúrọ̀ tí kò bọ́jú ṣáṣá?","But for a person of filthy habits, who would wake in the morning and not wash his or her face clean?","The Yoruba proverb ""Bí kò sí tọ̀bùn èèyàn, ta ni ìbá jí lówùúrọ̀ tí kò bọ́jú ṣáṣá?"" can be translated to English as: ""If there were no good people, who would wake up in the morning without being cautious?""

Explanation:
This proverb emphasizes the importance and presence of good people in society. It suggests that the existence of trustworthy and reliable individuals allows others to live without constant fear or suspicion. In a world without good people, everyone would have to be perpetually cautious and wary of potential harm or deceit. The proverb highlights the value of integrity and goodness, suggesting that they create a sense of security and peace in the community."
RAG,GPT,Àpọ́nlé ni “İyá-a Káà”; ìyá kan ò sí ní káà tí kò lórúkọ.,Calling a person “Mother of the Compound” is only a mark of respect; there is no mother in the compound who does not have a name.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Àpọ́nlé ni “İyá-a Káà”; ìyá kan ò sí ní káà tí kò lórúkọ"" can be translated to English as ""Respect is given to 'Mother of the Market'; there is no mother in the market without a name.""

**Explanation:**

This proverb emphasizes the importance of respect and recognition. In Yoruba culture, the market is a central place of commerce and social interaction, and the ""Mother of the Market"" is a respected figure. The proverb suggests that everyone, like the ""Mother of the Market,"" deserves respect and recognition because everyone has a name and identity. It highlights the idea that no one should be overlooked or disrespected, as everyone has their own significance and role in the community."
RAG,GPT,"Bí iná bá dun ọbẹ̀, a dá ọ̀rọ̀ sọ.","If the fire gets at the stew, the stew will burst into speech.","The Yoruba proverb ""Bí iná bá dun ọbẹ̀, a dá ọ̀rọ̀ sọ"" translates to ""If the stew is delicious, a conversation is started"" in English.

""Excess is the father of inadequacy; disgrace is the end of excess; an elder who wears the garment of excess will end in disgrace.""

Explanation:
This proverb warns against the dangers of excessiveness in behavior or actions. It suggests that going beyond reasonable limits often leads to negative consequences. The phrase ""Àṣejù baba àṣetẹ́"" (Excess is the father of inadequacy) implies that excessive behavior often results in failure or inadequacy. ""Ẹ̀tẹ́ ní ńgbẹ̀hìn àṣejù"" (disgrace is the end of excess) further emphasizes that the ultimate outcome of excess is disgrace. The final part, ""àgbàlagbà tó wẹ̀wù àṣejù ẹ̀tẹ́ ni yó fi rí"" (an elder who wears the garment of excess will end in disgrace), serves as a cautionary note, particularly to those who are expected to be wise and moderate, like elders, that indulging in excess will lead to shame and dishonor. Overall, the proverb advises moderation and balance in all things."
RAG,GPT,Ọjọ́ kan ṣoṣo là ńtẹ́; ojoojúmọ́ lojú ńtini.,It takes one day only for one to disgrace oneself; the shame is a daily affair.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ọjọ́ kan ṣoṣo là ńtẹ́; ojoojúmọ́ lojú ńtini"" translates to ""It is only one day that we use to spoil things; every day the eyes are red."" 

Explanation: This proverb highlights the idea that it takes only a moment or a single day to cause damage or ruin something, but the consequences or the stress from that action can linger and affect us continuously. The ""red eyes"" symbolize the ongoing stress, worry, or regret that follows a hasty or destructive action. It serves as a caution to be mindful of our actions, as their impact can be long-lasting."

This proverb emphasizes the importance of consistency and the logical sequence of actions. It suggests that certain actions or states are mutually exclusive. For example, if you are silent, you cannot be speaking at the same time, and if you are looking carefully, you should not miss your way. The proverb advises against contradictory behavior and highlights the need for coherence in one's actions and decisions. It serves as a reminder to be mindful and deliberate in our actions to avoid confusion and mistakes."
RAG,GPT,"Ṣe bóo ti mọ, ẹlẹ́wàa Ṣàpọ́n.","Moderate your preening and strutting, beautiful woman of Ṣàpọ́n.","The Yoruba proverb ""Ṣe bóo ti mọ, ẹlẹ́wàa Ṣàpọ́n"" can be translated to English as ""Is it as you know it, the bean seller of Sapon?"" 

Explanation: This proverb is often used to question someone's certainty or confidence about a situation. It implies that things may not always be as they seem or as one assumes. The mention of ""ẹlẹ́wàa Ṣàpọ́n"" (the bean seller of Sapon) is a metaphorical reference, suggesting that just as one might think they know the bean seller well, there might be aspects or details that are not immediately apparent. It serves as a reminder to be cautious and not overly confident in one's assumptions or knowledge."

This proverb is used to describe a situation where people are more concerned about someone's problems or misfortunes than the person themselves. It highlights the irony or peculiarity of a situation where the individual at the center of concern seems indifferent or unbothered by their own circumstances, while others around them are more worried or sympathetic. It can also imply that the person might be in denial or unaware of the gravity of their situation, or it could suggest resilience or a different perspective on their part."
RAG,GPT,Idà ahun la fi ńpa ahun.,It is with its own sword that one kills the tortoise.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Idà ahun la fi ńpa ahun"" translates to ""It is with the sword of the tortoise that we kill the tortoise."" 

This proverb conveys the idea that the solution to a problem often lies within the problem itself, or that the means to overcome a challenge can be found in the challenge. It suggests that sometimes, the tools or resources needed to address an issue are inherent in the situation. In a broader sense, it can also imply that one can use the characteristics or weaknesses of an adversary against them."

**Explanation:**

This proverb highlights the idea that certain things, regardless of their origin or initial purpose, can have a broader or more significant impact than expected. The first part of the proverb suggests that something seemingly small or insignificant (like a child's portion of food) can be sufficient or beneficial for someone much older or more experienced (an elder). It implies that wisdom, knowledge, or benefits can come from unexpected or humble sources.

The second part of the proverb contrasts this by stating that a child's ring cannot fit an elder's finger, emphasizing that not everything from a smaller or younger source can be applicable or suitable for an older or more mature context.

Overall, the proverb teaches the importance of recognizing the potential value in small or youthful contributions while also understanding the limitations that may come with them."

Explanation:
This proverb emphasizes the importance of taking responsibility and being proactive in managing one's affairs. In the context of a horse owner, ""pull it inside"" suggests the action of bringing the horse into a safe or secure place, which is a responsibility that falls on the owner.

This proverb conveys the idea of knowing one's limits and not overstepping boundaries. It suggests that one should not take on challenges or tasks that are beyond their capability or strength. Just as it would be unwise for a dog to venture into the wilderness to hunt a much stronger and more dangerous animal like a leopard, it is similarly unwise for a person to engage in endeavors that are beyond their capacity to handle. The proverb emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and prudence in decision-making."

Explanation:

It highlights the value of introspection and the ability to apply one's skills and knowledge to improve oneself. Essentially, it is a call for individuals to not only focus on external tasks but also to pay attention to their personal growth and development."
RAG,GPT,"Àpárá ńlá, ìjà ní ńdà.",Excessive ribbing unfailingly leads to a fight.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Àpárá ńlá, ìjà ní ńdà"" translates to ""A big scar provokes a fight"" in English. 

Explanation: This proverb suggests that significant or noticeable issues (symbolized by a ""big scar"") often lead to conflict or disputes (""a fight""). It implies that when there is a prominent problem or grievance, it is likely to cause tension or confrontation. The proverb serves as a reminder to address and resolve issues before they escalate into larger conflicts."
RAG,GPT,"Òní, ẹtú jìnfìn, ọ̀la, ẹtú jìnfìn; ẹtu nìkan lẹran tó wà nígbó?","Today, the antelope falls into the ditch; tomorrow, the antelope falls into the ditch; is the antelope the only animal in the forest?","The Yoruba proverb ""Òní, ẹtú jìnfìn, ọ̀la, ẹtú jìnfìn; ẹtu nìkan lẹran tó wà nígbó?"" translates to ""Today, the duiker is scarce, tomorrow, the duiker is scarce; is the duiker the only animal in the forest?""

This proverb is used to highlight the idea of over-reliance on a single source or option. It questions the wisdom of focusing on just one thing when there are many other possibilities available. The duiker, a type of small antelope, is used metaphorically to represent a resource or opportunity that is being overly depended upon. The proverb suggests that one should diversify their options and not put all their eggs in one basket, as there are many other opportunities (or ""animals in the forest"") to explore."
RAG,GPT,"Ìyàwó tó na ọmọ ọbàkan, ọ̀rọ̀ ló fẹ́ gbọ́.",The wife who whips a relative of her husband is asking for stern rebuke.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Ìyàwó tó na ọmọ ọbàkan, ọ̀rọ̀ ló fẹ́ gbọ́"" translates to ""The wife who beats the child of another wife wants to hear something"" in English.

Explanation:
In traditional Yoruba society, polygamy is common, and it is not unusual for a man to have multiple wives, each with her own children. This proverb highlights the dynamics and potential tensions within such a household. When a wife disciplines or beats the child of another wife, it is often seen as a provocative action. The proverb suggests that the wife is not merely disciplining the child but is likely trying to provoke a reaction or start a conversation, possibly to address underlying issues or grievances. It implies that her actions are intentional and aimed at eliciting a response, either from the child’s mother or from others in the household. This proverb serves as a caution against actions that may seem straightforward but have deeper, possibly disruptive, intentions."

Explanation:
This proverb emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and understanding one's limitations.

Explanation:
This proverb highlights the idea that it is better not to take on a responsibility or position of authority if one is not capable of handling it effectively. The phrase ""Ẹnuù mi ò ká ìlú"" (My mouth cannot encompass the town) suggests an inability to manage or control the affairs of the community. Therefore, it is preferable to avoid taking on such a role than to accept it and fail to fulfill its duties. The proverb emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's limitations and the wisdom in avoiding situations where one might be overwhelmed or unable to perform adequately."

Explanation:
This proverb emphasizes the value of personal ownership and authenticity. It suggests that relying on borrowed items or things that do not truly belong to you can lead to discomfort or problems. The proverb uses the metaphor of clothing to illustrate that what is not inherently yours may not fit well or serve you properly, and can even become a burden. Ultimately, it conveys the idea that what you own or what is genuinely yours is what is most suitable and beneficial for you. It encourages self-reliance and contentment with one's own possessions or circumstances."

Which one do you have there?""

This proverb is used to highlight the absurdity or irrelevance of asking unnecessary questions when the answer is either obvious or irrelevant to the situation. It suggests that one should focus on what is present or available rather than speculating or asking about things that are not pertinent. In essence, it advises against overthinking or complicating matters with unnecessary inquiries."

Translation:
""‘Welcome home’ is not appropriate for a resident; ‘Well done for your effort’ is not suitable for someone who is hiding; the person who does not greet others with ‘Well done for your effort’ will miss out on being greeted with ‘Welcome home.’""

Explanation:
This proverb emphasizes the importance of appropriate greetings and the reciprocal nature of social interactions. It suggests that certain greetings or acknowledgments are context-specific and should be used appropriately. For instance, saying ""Welcome home"" to someone who already lives there is unnecessary, just as saying ""Well done for your effort"" to someone who is not actively participating or contributing is inappropriate.

The proverb also highlights the idea of reciprocity in social relationships. If you do not acknowledge or greet others appropriately, you may not receive the same courtesy in return. It underscores the importance of being considerate and mindful in social interactions, as failing to do so can lead to missed opportunities for connection and mutual respect."
RAG,GPT,Ẹran kí la ò jẹ rí? Ọ̀pọ̀lọ́ báni lábàtà ó ba búrúbúrú.,"What sort of meat is it, the likes of which one has never tasted?

Explanation:
This proverb highlights the idea that someone who is experiencing intense emotions or anger often ends up taking actions or making decisions that benefit those who are less affected or less involved. It suggests that the person with the greater intensity of emotion (a-binú-fùfù) may inadvertently provide for or support someone who is only mildly affected (a-binú-wẹ́rẹ́-wẹ́rẹ́). It can be interpreted as a commentary on how strong emotions can lead to unintended consequences, often benefiting others who are not as deeply involved in the situation."

**Explanation:**

This proverb is used to describe situations or people that may seem problematic or troublesome at first glance but ultimately do not cause any lasting harm or damage.

It suggests resilience and the ability to withstand temporary setbacks without being adversely affected in the long run."

This proverb is used to highlight the idea that actions or behaviors often have underlying causes or motivations. In this context, the wagging of the dog's tail is a visible sign that something is happening, specifically that someone is eating. It suggests that when you see a reaction or a result, there is usually a reason behind it. The proverb encourages people to look beyond the surface and consider the underlying factors or causes of a situation."

Explanation:
This proverb highlights the different choices people make based on their characteristics or dispositions. Each type of person is associated with a particular food item that metaphorically represents their nature or approach to life:

1. **Afínjú (The fastidious or meticulous person)**: This person is described as eating ""ìwọ"" (shea butter), which is often associated with refinement and care. It suggests that meticulous people are selective and prefer things that are smooth and refined.

2. **Ọ̀mọ̀ràn (The wise person)**: This person eats ""obì"" (kola nut), which is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge in Yoruba culture. Kola nuts are often used in traditional ceremonies and are associated with thoughtfulness and insight.

3. **Màrí-màjẹ (The indiscriminate eater)**: This person eats ""awùsá"" (locust bean), which is a common and less refined food item. It implies that those who are not selective or discerning will consume whatever is available, without much thought or care.

Overall, the proverb emphasizes the idea that people's choices reflect their personalities and values. It suggests that being selective and wise in one's choices is preferable to being indiscriminate."

The proverb encourages patience and faith in the process, assuring that true efforts will not go unrewarded."

### Explanation:

Explanation:

It emphasizes the importance of inner wisdom and knowledge over external appearances or status. This proverb encourages respect for the wisdom of elders, regardless of their current standing or influence in the community."

RAG,GPT,"Bí eegbọ́n bá ṣo ayínrín nímú, adìẹ kọ́ ni yó ja.","If a tick clings to a fox's nose, it is not a chicken that will remove it.","The Yoruba proverb ""Bí eegbọ́n bá ṣo ayínrín nímú, adìẹ kọ́ ni yó ja"" translates to ""If the elder sniffs the sand, the chicken will not peck it."" 

Explanation: This proverb emphasizes the importance of leadership and the influence of elders or those in authority. It suggests that when a respected or wise person (the elder) takes a particular action or sets an example, others (represented by the chicken) will follow suit or refrain from certain actions. It highlights the role of elders in guiding and setting standards for the community, implying that their actions can prevent others from making mistakes or engaging in undesirable behavior."
RAG,GPT,À-sẹ́-kú làgbàlagbà ńsẹ́ ọ̀ràn.,Denying-until-death is the way a venerable person denies a matter.,"The Yoruba proverb ""À-sẹ́-kú làgbàlagbà ńsẹ́ ọ̀ràn"" can be translated to English as ""An elder handles matters with what is left undone."" 

Explanation: This proverb emphasizes the wisdom and experience of elders in resolving issues. It suggests that an elder, with their accumulated knowledge and understanding, can address and manage problems effectively, even when it seems like there is little left to work with. The phrase ""à-sẹ́-kú"" (what is left undone) implies that an elder can make the most out of limited resources or incomplete situations, using their insight to bring about resolution or improvement. It highlights the value of experience and the ability to navigate complex situations with what is available."
RAG,GPT,"Ìṣẹ̀ ò ti ibìkan mú ẹni; ìyà ò tibìkan jẹ èèyàn; bí o bá rìnrìn òṣì, bí o bá ojú ìṣẹ́ wọ̀lú, igbá-kúgbá ni wọn ó fi bu omi fún ẹ mu.","Destitution does not attach to one at a particular place; suffering does not attack a person at a particular place; if one walks like a wretch into a town, if one looks like a loser when one enters a town, it is with a miserable calabash that the people will offer one water to drink.","The Yoruba proverb ""Ìṣẹ̀ ò ti ibìkan mú ẹni; ìyà ò tibìkan jẹ èèyàn; bí o bá rìnrìn òṣì, bí o bá ojú ìṣẹ́ wọ̀lú, igbá-kúgbá ni wọn ó fi bu omi fún ẹ mu"" can be translated to English as:

""Poverty does not come from one place; suffering does not affect a person from one direction; if you wander in poverty and look at the world through the lens of hardship, they will serve you water in a broken calabash.""

Explanation:

This proverb highlights the idea that poverty and suffering are not caused by a single factor or source. Instead, they can arise from various circumstances and directions. It suggests that when someone is experiencing hardship, they may be treated with less respect or given inadequate resources, as symbolized by being served water in a broken calabash. The proverb serves as a reflection on the nature of poverty and the societal attitudes towards those who are struggling, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of hardship and the often unsympathetic response from society."
RAG,GPT,"Oòrùn, kó tìẹ wọ̀ ká má bàá Ọlọ́jọ́ wí.","Sun, go set so one does not blame the owner of the day.","The Yoruba proverb ""Oòrùn, kó tìẹ wọ̀ ká má bàá Ọlọ́jọ́ wí"" translates to ""Sun, set so that we do not blame the owner of the day"" in English.

Explanation:
This proverb is a metaphorical expression that emphasizes the importance of allowing natural processes to take their course without interference or undue haste. The ""sun"" represents a natural or inevitable process, and ""the owner of the day"" symbolizes someone in charge or responsible for the situation. The proverb suggests that we should be patient and let things unfold in their own time, rather than rushing or forcing outcomes, which could lead to unnecessary blame or conflict. It teaches the value of patience and understanding in dealing with situations beyond our control."
RAG,GPT,"Mo dàgbà mo dàgó, aré ọmọdé ò tán lójúù mi.","I have become old and wise, but childish play has not ceased to appeal to me.","The Yoruba proverb ""Mo dàgbà mo dàgó, aré ọmọdé ò tán lójúù mi"" can be translated to English as ""I have grown old and matured, yet the playfulness of childhood is not lost on me.""

Explanation:
This proverb reflects the idea that no matter how much one ages or matures, there is still a part of them that retains the innocence, curiosity, or playfulness of childhood. It suggests that growing older does not necessarily mean losing one's youthful spirit or sense of wonder. The proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance between maturity and the joyful, carefree aspects of being young."
RAG,GPT,Olóbìnrin kan kì í pagbo ìja.,A person who has only  one wife does not form a circle for a fight.,"The Yoruba proverb ""Olóbìnrin kan kì í pagbo ìja"" translates to ""A single woman does not win a war"" in English. 

This proverb emphasizes the importance of collaboration and collective effort. It suggests that significant challenges or battles cannot be successfully overcome by an individual alone, regardless of their strength or capabilities. Instead, it highlights the need for teamwork, support, and unity to achieve success, especially in difficult situations. The proverb can be applied to various contexts, encouraging people to seek help and work together rather than trying to tackle problems on their own."
RAG,Anthropic,Ojú ò rọ́lá rí; ó bímọ ẹ̀ ó sọ ọ́ ní Ọláníyọnu.,A person only newly acquainted with wealth; he has a son and names him Ọlaniyọnu.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Proverb**: ""Ojú ò rọ́lá rí; ó bímọ ẹ̀ ó sọ ọ́ ní Ọláníyọnu.""

**Literal Translation**: ""The eye has never seen wealth/honor; it gave birth to a child and named it 'Wealth/Honor is sweet/desirable.'""

**Meaning**: This proverb is ironic in nature. It points out the contradiction of someone who has never experienced wealth or honor (ojú ò rọ́lá rí) yet names their child ""Ọláníyọnu"" (meaning ""wealth/honor is sweet""). 

**Deeper Explanation**: The proverb criticizes people who praise or glorify things they have never personally experienced. It highlights the irony of speaking authoritatively about something one doesn't truly know. In Yoruba culture, naming is significant and often reflects aspirations or circumstances, so naming a child ""Wealth is sweet"" when you've never had wealth shows either hopeful aspiration or pretension.

This proverb serves as a caution against pretending to have knowledge about experiences one hasn't actually had, or speaking with authority about unfamiliar situations."
RAG,Anthropic,Ìwọ̀n eku nìwọ̀n ìtẹ́; olongo kì í gbé tìmùtìmù.,The measure of the rat is the measure of the nest; a robin does not live on a cushion.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:** ""The size of a rat determines the size of its trap; a cat does not carry what is too heavy for it.""

**Meaning:** This proverb teaches about knowing one's limitations and capabilities. It suggests that every person has their natural capacity or limit, just as a trap must be proportional to the rat it aims to catch, and a cat will not attempt to carry what is beyond its strength.

**Cultural explanation:** In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and recognizing one's boundaries. It counsels against attempting tasks beyond one's abilities or means. The imagery of the rat trap needing to match the rat's size, and the cat knowing not to attempt carrying excessive loads, illustrates how nature itself demonstrates the principle of operating within one's capacity.

This proverb would be used to advise someone to be realistic about their abilities, to avoid overreaching, and to understand that success comes from working within one's natural capabilities rather than attempting the impossible."
RAG,Anthropic,"Ẹyẹ tó fi ara wé igún, ẹ̀hìn àdìrò ní ńsùn.",Whatever bird emulates the vulture will find itself behind the cooking hearth.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Ẹyẹ tó fi ara wé igún, ẹ̀hìn àdìrò ní ńsùn""

**Translation:**
""The bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind the chicken coop.""

**Explanation:**
This Yoruba proverb warns about the consequences of inappropriate self-comparison or aspiring beyond one's capabilities. The vulture (igún) is a powerful bird that soars high and has a certain status, while the bird that merely pretends to be like a vulture lacks the actual capabilities and ends up in a lowly position - sleeping behind the chicken coop (àdìrò).

The proverb teaches that pretending to be something you're not or comparing yourself to those far above your station without having the necessary qualities or abilities will only lead to disappointment and possibly humiliation. It encourages people to be authentic and to develop themselves genuinely rather than merely imitating others or putting on airs.

This wisdom applies to situations where people try to claim status, importance, or abilities they haven't earned or don't possess."
RAG,Anthropic,Àwúrèbeé ní òún lè yẹ̀nà; ta ní jẹ́ tọ ọ̀nà àwúrèbe?,Àwúrebe says it can make a path; who would wish to follow a path it makes?,"# Translation and Explanation

The proverb ""Àwúrèbeé ní òún lè yẹ̀nà; ta ní jẹ́ tọ ọ̀nà àwúrèbe?"" translates to:

""The termite claims it can clear a path; who would follow the path of a termite?""

## Explanation:
This Yoruba proverb uses the metaphor of a termite (àwúrèbe) boasting about its ability to clear a path, when in reality, a termite's ""path"" would be too small and insignificant for humans to follow. 

The proverb speaks to someone who makes grand claims or boasts about capabilities that are clearly exaggerated or inappropriate for the situation. It's a commentary on empty boasting or misplaced confidence, especially when someone claims they can lead or accomplish something beyond their actual capacity.

The proverb teaches discernment in choosing whom to follow or trust, warning against being deceived by those who overstate their abilities but cannot actually deliver on their promises."
RAG,Anthropic,"Má tẹ̀ẹ́ lọ́wọ́ oníle, má tẹ̀ẹ́ lọ́wọ́ àlejò; lọ́wọ́ ara ẹni la ti ńtẹ́.","Save face with members of your household and save face with complete strangers, such a person loses face with himself/herself.","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Proverb**: ""Má tẹ̀ẹ́ lọ́wọ́ oníle, má tẹ̀ẹ́ lọ́wọ́ àlejò; lọ́wọ́ ara ẹni la ti ńtẹ́.""

**Direct Translation**: ""Don't lean on the hand of the house owner, don't lean on the hand of the visitor; it is on one's own hand that one should lean.""

**Explanation**: 
This proverb emphasizes self-reliance and personal responsibility. It advises that one should not depend on others for support or success - neither on those who seem established (the house owner) nor on those who are temporary in your life (the visitor). Instead, the proverb teaches that true strength and stability come from depending on your own resources, abilities, and efforts.

The wisdom here reflects the Yoruba cultural value of independence and personal accountability. It encourages people to develop their own capabilities rather than becoming dependent on others, regardless of how permanent or temporary those others might be in one's life."
RAG,Anthropic,Eégún ju eégún; òrìṣá ju òrìṣà; Pààká lé oníṣàngó wọ̀gbẹ́.,Some masqueraders are greater than others; some gods are greater than others; the masquerader Pààká chases the Ṣàngó worshipper into the bush.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Eégún ju eégún; òrìṣá ju òrìṣà; Pààká lé oníṣàngó wọ̀gbẹ́.""

## Translation:
""One masquerade surpasses another masquerade; one deity surpasses another deity; the leopard chased the devotee of Sango into the bush.""

## Explanation:
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the concept of hierarchy and relative power. It conveys that in any category or class, there are always different levels of strength, authority, or capability.

The proverb uses three parallel examples:
1. Among masquerades (eégún), some are more powerful than others
2. Among deities (òrìṣá), some rank higher than others
3. Even a Sango worshipper (oníṣàngó), who serves the powerful deity of thunder, will flee into the bush when confronted by a leopard (pààká)

The deeper meaning teaches humility and warns against overconfidence. No matter how powerful or important one might be in their sphere, there is always someone or something more powerful. Even those who draw their identity from powerful associations (like the Sango worshipper) will find themselves humbled when confronted with a superior force (the leopard).

This proverb is often used to counsel people against excessive pride or to remind someone that power is always relative, not absolute."
RAG,Anthropic,"“Mo yó” ńjẹ́ “mo yó,” “mo kọ̀” ńjẹ́ “mo kọ̀”; jẹun ǹṣó, àgbà ọ̀kánjúwà ni.","“I am full” means “I am full”; “I decline” means “I decline”; eating with abandon, that is the father of all greediness.","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

## Translation
""I am full"" says ""I am full,"" ""I refuse"" says ""I refuse""; to eat alone is the behavior of an elderly greedy person.

## Explanation
This proverb criticizes selfishness and greed, particularly among those who should know better due to their age or position. It portrays someone eating alone while making excuses like ""I am full"" or ""I refuse"" to avoid sharing food with others.

In Yoruba culture, sharing food is a fundamental social value that demonstrates generosity and community spirit. The proverb condemns those who eat in isolation and use false excuses to avoid sharing with others. The reference to an elderly person (àgbà) makes the criticism more pointed, as elders are expected to model proper behavior in the community.

This proverb would typically be used to admonish someone who is being selfish with their resources or to warn against the social consequences of greed and self-centeredness."
RAG,Anthropic,Àgbàlagbà kì í wẹwọ́ tán kó ní òun ó jẹ si.,An elder does not wash his hand and then decide to eat more.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Àgbàlagbà kì í wẹwọ́ tán kó ní òun ó jẹ si.""

## Translation
""An elder doesn't wash their hands and then claim they'll eat later.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the importance of seizing opportunities promptly and the wisdom that comes with age and experience. When an elder washes their hands in preparation for a meal, they do so with the immediate intention to eat, not to delay or postpone.

The proverb teaches that:

1. Preparedness should be followed by immediate action
2. Experienced people (elders) understand that timing is critical 
3. One should not delay taking advantage of opportunities once ready

In Yoruba culture, elders are respected for their wisdom and practical knowledge. This proverb highlights how a wise person recognizes that preparation without follow-through diminishes the value of being prepared. It can be applied to many situations where someone prepares for something but then unnecessarily delays taking action."
RAG,Anthropic,Ẹni à bá tà ká fowó-o rẹ̀ ra àdá: ó ní ìyà àdá ńjẹ òun.,A person who should be sold for money to purchase a machete bemoans his lack of a machete.,"# Translation and Explanation of Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:**
""The person who is sold and the money is used to buy a cutlass: he says the cutlass is making him suffer.""

**Meaning:**
This proverb refers to someone who is caught in a situation where they're being harmed by something that came from their own exploitation. It describes a person who was sold into slavery, and the money from that sale was used to purchase a cutlass (machete), which is now being used to make that same person work hard or suffer.

**Explanation:**
The proverb illustrates a double injustice - not only was the person sold (exploited), but the proceeds were used to buy a tool that became the instrument of their ongoing suffering. It's often used to describe situations where someone is not only victimized once, but the initial victimization leads to continued hardship for them.

This proverb teaches about the compounding nature of injustice and is used when commenting on situations where someone suffers multiple consequences from a single unfortunate event."
RAG,Anthropic,"Kàkà ká dọ̀bálẹ̀ fún Gàm̀bàrí, ká rọ́jú ká kú.","Rather than prostrate oneself in homage or obeisance to a Hausa person, one should rather die.","# Translation and Explanation of Yoruba Proverb

The proverb ""Kàkà ká dọ̀bálẹ̀ fún Gàm̀bàrí, ká rọ́jú ká kú"" translates to:

""Rather than prostrate (bow down) for a Hausa man, it is better to stand firm and die.""

## Explanation:
This proverb expresses the Yoruba cultural value of dignity and pride, particularly in the historical context of inter-ethnic relations. ""Gàm̀bàrí"" refers to Hausa people (from northern Nigeria), and ""dọ̀bálẹ̀"" is the Yoruba custom of prostrating as a sign of respect.

The proverb suggests that maintaining one's dignity and self-respect, even at the cost of death, is preferable to submitting oneself to humiliation or surrendering one's values to people considered outsiders or potential oppressors.

This reflects traditional Yoruba emphasis on honor and the belief that some principles are worth defending even at great personal cost. It speaks to the values of courage, self-respect, and resistance to subjugation."
RAG,Anthropic,À-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa ẹmọ́n; à-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa àfè; à-jẹ-ì-kúrò ní ńpa máláàjú.,Feeding-without-leaving kills the Tullberg's rat; feeding-without-departing kills the spotted grass mouse; feeding-without-departing kills the máláàjú rat.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal Translation:**
""It is refusing-to-leave that kills the housefly; it is refusing-to-leave that kills the moth; it is refusing-to-leave that kills the insect.""

**Meaning:**
This proverb speaks to the danger of overstaying one's welcome or failing to recognize when it's time to depart a situation. It warns that persistence in the wrong context leads to destruction.

**Explanation:**
The proverb uses three examples of insects (housefly, moth, and small insect) that often meet their demise because they linger too long in dangerous places. For example:
- The housefly that refuses to leave food will eventually be swatted
- The moth that stays around a flame will get burned
- The small insect that doesn't flee from danger will be crushed

This wisdom applies to human situations where knowing when to withdraw is essential for survival. It teaches that recognizing the right moment to exit a harmful situation, relationship, or endeavor is critical to avoiding disaster.

The proverb essentially counsels discernment and cautions against stubborn persistence when circumstances clearly indicate it's time to move on."
RAG,Anthropic,"A kì í fi ìka ro etí, ká fi ro imú, ká wá tún fi ta ehín.","One does not use one's finger to clean one's ear passages, use it to pick one's nose, and then use it to pick one's teeth.","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal Translation:** ""One doesn't use the finger to clean the ear, then use it to clean the nose, and then use it to pick the teeth.""

**Meaning:** This proverb warns against using the same instrument or approach for different tasks that require different tools or methods, especially when doing so could spread contamination or create problems. It teaches about the importance of using appropriate tools for specific tasks and avoiding cross-contamination.

**Cultural Context:** In Yoruba culture, this proverb emphasizes proper hygiene and appropriate conduct. It conveys wisdom about the importance of boundaries and proper order in doing things.

**Broader Application:** Beyond its literal hygiene advice, the proverb applies to various life situations where one should:
- Use appropriate methods for different challenges
- Avoid carrying problems from one situation to another
- Maintain proper boundaries between different aspects of life
- Not apply solutions that worked in one context to entirely different situations

The proverb teaches discretion, appropriateness, and the wisdom of using the right approach for each specific situation."
RAG,Anthropic,"Ṣàkì ńṣe bí ọ̀rá, egungun ńṣe bí ẹran.",The tripe presents itself as fat; the bone presents itself as meat.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Proverb**: ""Ṣàkì ńṣe bí ọ̀rá, egungun ńṣe bí ẹran.""

**Translation**: ""The shroud pretends to be velvet, while the masquerade pretends to be human.""

**Explanation**:
This proverb speaks to deceptive appearances and false pretenses. In Yoruba culture:
- ""Ṣàkì"" refers to a burial shroud or cloth
- ""Ọ̀rá"" refers to velvet or fine cloth
- ""Egungun"" refers to a masquerade or ancestral spirit costume
- ""Ẹran"" means flesh/human

The proverb points out how things may appear to be something they are not. The burial shroud might look impressive like velvet, but it's still just a burial cloth. Similarly, the masquerade costume may appear human-like, but there's just a person underneath the costume.

This wisdom cautions against being deceived by outward appearances and reminds us that things are not always what they seem. It teaches discernment between genuine substance and mere imitation."
RAG,Anthropic,Ọ̀yájú-u baálé ní ńpàdé ìbòsí lọ́nà.,It is a reckless home owner who is met with alarms when he ventures outside.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Ọ̀yájú-u baálé ní ńpàdé ìbòsí lọ́nà""

## Translation
""It is the landlord who is in a hurry that meets the tenant on the road.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the consequences of impatience and overanxiousness, particularly by those in positions of authority. The proverb describes a scenario where a landlord, who should typically wait at home to receive rent or meet with tenants, is so impatient that he goes out searching for the tenant - only to encounter them already on their way to him.

The deeper meaning suggests that:
1. Patience is rewarded - what you're seeking may already be on its way to you
2. Rushing can create unnecessary complications or embarrassment
3. Those in authority (like landlords) should trust in the process and wait for things to come to them in due time

This proverb is often used to counsel patience and warn against the folly of excessive eagerness, especially when someone is anxiously pursuing what would naturally come to them if they simply waited."
RAG,Anthropic,Àgbàlagbà tí ò kí Ààrẹ ńfi okùn sin ara-a rẹ̀.,An elder who does not greet the Ààrẹ tries a “hanging” rope for size.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Àgbàlagbà tí ò kí Ààrẹ ńfi okùn sin ara-a rẹ̀""

**Literal translation:** ""An elder who refuses to greet the Aare (chief/king) is preparing a rope to bury himself.""

**Meaning:** This Yoruba proverb warns about the consequences of disrespecting authority or failing to observe proper social protocols. It suggests that an elder who knowingly disregards proper etiquette toward someone in power is essentially bringing trouble upon themselves - metaphorically preparing for their own funeral.

**Cultural context:** In Yoruba culture, respecting hierarchies and showing proper deference to authority figures is extremely important. Elders especially are expected to model proper behavior and social protocols. The proverb highlights that even those of high status (elders) are not exempt from showing respect to those in positions of power (the Aare/chief).

**Application:** The proverb can be used to caution someone against unnecessary defiance of authority or deliberate disregard for social norms that might lead to serious negative consequences."
RAG,Anthropic,"Àì-lápá làdá ò mú; bí a bá lápá, ọmọ owú to-o gégi.",It is a deficiency of biceps that blunts the machete; if one has strong biceps one can cut trees with a cudgel.,"# Translation and Explanation: ""Àì-lápá làdá ò mú; bí a bá lápá, ọmọ owú to-o gégi.""

## Literal Translation:
""It's lack of arm strength that makes the machete not sharp; if one has arm strength, a cotton thread can cut a tree.""

## Meaning:
This Yoruba proverb emphasizes that what often appears to be inadequacy in our tools or resources is actually a reflection of our own lack of determination, strength, or effort. The proverb suggests that with sufficient determination and energy (arm strength), even seemingly impossible tasks can be accomplished - to the point where something as delicate as cotton thread could cut through a tree.

## Cultural Context:
In Yoruba culture, this proverb is used to encourage people to stop blaming their tools or circumstances for their failures. Instead, it urges people to look inward at their own commitment and effort level. It reflects the cultural value placed on determination, personal responsibility, and the belief that human willpower can overcome material limitations.

## Usage:
This proverb might be used when someone complains about inadequate resources rather than focusing on what they can achieve with what they have. It serves as both encouragement and gentle admonishment to put in more effort rather than making excuses."
RAG,Anthropic,Ibi tí a fi ara sí lara ńgbé.,"Wherever one situates the body, there it inhabits.","# Translation of ""Ibi tí a fi ara sí lara ńgbé""

**Literal translation:** ""Where we put our body is where the body lives/dwells.""

**Idiomatic translation:** ""One thrives where one invests oneself"" or ""The place where you dedicate yourself is where you will prosper.""

## Explanation

This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the relationship between personal investment and success. It suggests that we flourish in the environments, relationships, or endeavors where we commit our energy, attention, and efforts.

The proverb uses the metaphor of the physical body to represent one's whole self - including effort, attention, and commitment. It teaches that genuine dedication to a place, relationship, or pursuit leads to growth and prosperity there.

In practical terms, this wisdom applies to many aspects of life:
- A business thrives where you invest your time and resources
- Relationships flourish when you give them genuine attention
- Skills develop where you focus your practice

This reflects the universal principle that meaningful growth comes from purposeful investment of oneself."
RAG,Anthropic,"Bí ìlàrí bá fẹ́ tẹ́, a ní kí lọba ó ṣe?","When a courtier seeks disgrace, he asks, “What can the king do?”","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

The proverb ""Bí ìlàrí bá fẹ́ tẹ́, a ní kí lọba ó ṣe?"" translates to:

""If the palace servant wants to rebel/misbehave, they ask what can the king do about it?""

## Explanation:
This proverb refers to a situation where a subordinate (the ""ìlàrí"" or palace servant) becomes defiant or disrespectful toward authority (the ""ọba"" or king). The proverb captures the arrogance and misplaced confidence of someone who challenges authority despite their lower position.

In Yoruba culture, the king has ultimate power and authority, while palace servants are expected to be obedient and respectful. When a servant becomes rebellious and questions what consequences the king could possibly impose, it demonstrates foolish defiance because the king has numerous ways to discipline or punish disobedient subjects.

The proverb is used to caution against challenging those who have authority over you, and serves as a warning about the consequences of insubordination or forgetting one's place in a hierarchical structure."
RAG,Anthropic,Àfi ohun tí a kì í tà lọ́jà lẹrú kì í jẹ.,The only thing a slave cannot eat is something not available in the market.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:** ""Only what is not sold in the market is what a slave cannot eat.""

**Meaning:** This proverb means that a slave can eat anything that is available in the market or anything that is commonly accessible. The only foods a slave cannot access are those that are not even available for sale in the marketplace.

**Deeper explanation:** 
This proverb speaks to the limited restrictions on what enslaved people could consume in traditional Yoruba society. While slaves had a lower social status, their basic needs like food were generally met with whatever was commonly available. The proverb ironically highlights that slaves weren't restricted from common foods - only from things so rare or precious that they couldn't even be found in the marketplace.

In contemporary usage, this proverb can be applied to situations where people claim they're being denied something that isn't actually available to anyone. It reminds us that some limitations affect everyone equally, not just those in disadvantaged positions."
RAG,Anthropic,Àṣá kì í rà kádìẹ gbé kòkòrò dání.,"When a kite hovers, a chicken does not hang on to an insect.","# Translation and Explanation of ""Àṣá kì í rà kádìẹ gbé kòkòrò dání""

**Literal translation:** The hawk does not swoop down for the chicken to catch insects for it.

**Meaning and explanation:** This Yoruba proverb speaks to the natural order of power relationships and responsibilities. The hawk is a predator that hunts chickens, so it would be absurd for a hawk to expect its prey (the chicken) to serve it by catching insects. 

The proverb teaches that:
1. Those in positions of power shouldn't expect those beneath them to do work that they themselves should be doing
2. One shouldn't depend on a subordinate or someone in a weaker position to fulfill one's responsibilities
3. It's inappropriate to shift your duties to those who should be under your protection

This is similar to saying ""the boss shouldn't rely on the employee to do the boss's job"" or warning against role reversal where the powerful expect service from the vulnerable."
RAG,Anthropic,"Ká wí ogún, ká wí ọgbọ̀n, “Ng ò fẹ́, ng ò gbà” laṣiwèré fi ńpẹ̀kun ọ̀ràn.","Whether one speaks twenty times or speaks thirty times, “I do not like it, and I will not accept it” is how the imbecile ends the discussion.","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal Translation:**
""After saying twenty, after saying thirty, 'I don't want it, I don't accept it' is how a fool ends a matter.""

**Meaning:**
This proverb criticizes stubbornness and unreasonable rejection of good advice or negotiations. It suggests that when wise counsel is given repeatedly (symbolized by counting ""twenty"" and ""thirty"" - representing multiple attempts at persuasion), only a foolish person abruptly ends the discussion with outright rejection (""I don't want it, I don't accept it"").

**Cultural Context:**
In Yoruba culture, elders and wise people are expected to discuss matters thoroughly, considering different perspectives before reaching a conclusion. This proverb highlights the value placed on patience, listening, and thoughtful consideration in decision-making processes.

**Application:**
The proverb is used to caution against hasty dismissal of advice or opportunities without proper consideration. It teaches that wisdom involves listening to multiple viewpoints before making decisions, rather than stubbornly refusing to engage with suggestions or proposals."
RAG,Anthropic,Ẹni tí a fẹ́ yàtọ̀ sí ẹni tó ní kò sí irú òun.,A person one loves is different from a person who says there is no one like him/herself.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Ẹni tí a fẹ́ yàtọ̀ sí ẹni tó ní kò sí irú òun""

**Translation:** ""The person we love is different from the one who claims there's no one like them.""

**Explanation:** 
This Yoruba proverb contrasts two types of people - someone who is genuinely loved by others versus someone who boasts about their uniqueness or superiority. It suggests that true worth is determined by how others perceive and value you, not by self-proclamation.

The proverb teaches humility and warns against arrogance. In Yoruba culture, being loved and respected by the community is considered more valuable than self-importance. The person who is genuinely loved doesn't need to boast about their qualities, while the one who brags about being incomparable may not actually be held in high esteem by others.

It relates to the other proverbs you provided which similarly address social acceptance versus rejection in community contexts."
RAG,Anthropic,Àgùnbánirọ̀ ní ńfojúdini.,It is the person taller than another who shows no respect for the other.,"# Translation of ""Àgùnbánirọ̀ ní ńfojúdini""

**Literal translation:** ""The one who rolls in dirt is the one who attracts stares.""

**Meaning:** This Yoruba proverb conveys that a person who behaves inappropriately or disgracefully will naturally attract negative attention and criticism from others.

**Explanation:** The proverb uses the metaphor of someone who physically rolls in dirt (àgùnbánirọ̀) and consequently draws stares (fojúdini) from onlookers. In Yoruba culture, this teaches that inappropriate conduct, immoral behavior, or actions that violate social norms will inevitably result in public scrutiny and judgment.

The wisdom here cautions people to be mindful of their behavior, as those who act dishonorably or in undignified ways should expect to become objects of public attention and criticism."

""A creeping plant that is as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant from going; a creeping plant that says an elephant should not go to Alo, both the creeping plant and the elephant will go there.""

**Explanation:**
This Yoruba proverb uses the imagery of a climbing vine (ìtàkùn) that has grown impressively tall (as tall as a palm tree) but still lacks the strength to restrain an elephant. The proverb emphasizes that despite appearances or claims of power, one cannot prevent what is inevitable or stop someone more powerful from their chosen path.

The second part reinforces this by suggesting that if the vine attempts to prevent the elephant from going to a specific place (Alo), the vine will actually be dragged along with the elephant - meaning that not only will the attempt fail, but the one trying to obstruct will be carried along by the force they tried to resist.

This proverb teaches about recognizing power dynamics and the futility of opposing forces much greater than oneself. It counsels humility and wisdom in choosing one's battles, particularly against those with significantly more power or authority."
RAG,Anthropic,"Bí a bá ńgúnyán, kòmẹsẹ̀ á yọ.","If one prepares pounded yams, the uninvited should depart.","# Translation and Explanation of ""Bí a bá ńgúnyán, kòmẹsẹ̀ á yọ""

## Translation
""If we are pounding yam, the pestle will rise up and down.""
(Literally: ""If we are pounding yam, the pestle will emerge/appear"")

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the natural consequences that follow certain actions. When pounding yam (a traditional food preparation method using a mortar and pestle), it's inevitable that the pestle must move up and down repeatedly.

The proverb teaches that certain processes have predictable patterns or outcomes that cannot be avoided. It's used to emphasize that actions have natural consequences that must be accepted. Just as you cannot pound yam without the up-and-down motion of the pestle, you cannot engage in certain activities without experiencing their inherent effects.

In practical application, this proverb might be used to counsel someone to accept the challenges or difficulties that naturally come with their chosen path or undertaking."
RAG,Anthropic,Ọmọ àì-jọbẹ̀-rí tí ńja epo sáyà.,A child new to eating stews: he shows himself by dripping palm-oil on his chest.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Ọmọ àì-jọbẹ̀-rí tí ńja epo sáyà""

## Translation
""A child who has never seen soup but is smearing palm oil on their chest.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb refers to someone who misuses or wastes a valuable resource because they don't understand its proper purpose or value. Palm oil is an important cooking ingredient in Yoruba cuisine, primarily used in making soup. The proverb describes a child who has never seen soup (the proper use of palm oil) yet uses the precious palm oil merely to rub on their chest (a wasteful misuse).

The proverb is used to criticize people who misapply valuable resources or opportunities because they lack understanding or experience. It's similar to the English expression ""pearls before swine,"" suggesting that giving valuable things to those who don't appreciate their worth leads to waste or misuse.

This saying is often applied to situations where someone lacks the experience or knowledge to properly value or utilize what they have been given."
RAG,Anthropic,Kì í dọwọ́-ọ baba kó ló di ọwọ́ ọmọ.,Responsibility does not devolve on the father only for him to say it is his son's duty.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Kì í dọwọ́-ọ baba kó ló di ọwọ́ ọmọ""

## Translation
""It does not get out of the father's hand and then become the child's responsibility.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb emphasizes parental responsibility and accountability. It means that a father (or parent) should not abandon his responsibilities and shift them to his children. Parents should handle their own obligations rather than passing their burdens to their children.

The proverb speaks to the cultural value in Yoruba society of proper parental roles and responsibilities. It can be applied in situations where:

1. A parent tries to make their children solve problems they should be handling themselves
2. Elders attempt to shift their responsibilities to younger generations
3. Leaders attempt to blame subordinates for their own failings

It's a call for people, especially those in authority, to take responsibility for their actions and duties rather than passing them on to those under their care."
RAG,Anthropic,"Ó yẹ ẹni gbogbo kó dínwó aró, kò yẹ atọ̀ọ́lé.","It is fitting for everybody to bargain to reduce the cost of dyeing clothes, but not the bed wetter.","# Translation and Explanation of ""Ó yẹ ẹni gbogbo kó dínwó aró, kò yẹ atọ̀ọ́lé.""

**Translation:**
""It is fitting for everyone to reduce the price of indigo dye, but not for the dye maker.""

**Explanation:**
This Yoruba proverb speaks to conflicts of interest and perspective. While the general public might benefit from lower prices for indigo dye (a valuable commodity in traditional Yoruba society), the dye maker (atọ̀ọ́lé) whose livelihood depends on selling it would be harmed by such price reductions.

The proverb illustrates how people's opinions and desires are often shaped by their personal interests. What seems beneficial from one perspective may be detrimental from another. It warns against making judgments about situations without considering how they affect all parties involved, especially those with a direct stake in the matter.

In broader application, this wisdom cautions against advocating for changes that don't affect you personally while ignoring the impact on those directly involved in the profession or situation."
RAG,Anthropic,Ìbàjẹ́ ọjọ́ kan ò tán bọ̀rọ̀.,The disgrace one incurs in one day does not disappear that soon.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Ìbàjẹ́ ọjọ́ kan ò tán bọ̀rọ̀""

**Literal translation:** ""The spoiling of one day doesn't end in vain/easily.""

**Meaning:** This Yoruba proverb suggests that a single bad day or unfortunate event has consequences that extend beyond just that day. The effects of misfortune or poor decisions can linger and continue to impact one's life for a long time.

**Cultural context:** In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb teaches about cause and effect, consequences, and the importance of caution. It warns people to be careful with their actions and decisions, as even a single mistake can have long-lasting repercussions that aren't easily dismissed or forgotten.

**Usage:** People might use this proverb when counseling others to be prudent, when reflecting on how past events continue to affect the present, or when explaining why a seemingly small problem has created larger complications."
RAG,Anthropic,"Ibi tí a ti ńpìtàn ká tó jogún, ká mọ̀ pé ogún ibẹ̀ ò kanni.","Where one must recite genealogies in order to establish one's claim to inheritance, one should know that one really has no claim to patrimony there.","# Translation and Explanation

## Translation
""The place where we are being told stories before inheriting property, we should know that the inheritance there does not concern us.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to recognizing one's true position in a situation. It suggests that if you are being kept at a distance (being told stories or given explanations) before accessing an inheritance, you should recognize that you're not actually meant to be a beneficiary.

The proverb teaches about recognizing subtle signs of exclusion. In Yoruba culture, inheritance typically passes directly to rightful heirs without extensive preliminaries. If someone is being given lengthy explanations or stories before receiving their inheritance, it's a sign they're being diplomatically sidelined.

The wisdom here is about understanding social cues and your true position in relationships - if you're being treated as an outsider regarding something you supposedly have rights to, you should recognize the reality of your situation rather than clinging to false hope."
RAG,Anthropic,"Bí baálẹ̀-ẹ́ bá ńtàkìtì, òrógi là ḿbá ẹmẹsẹ̀.","If the chief is turning somersaults, the messenger should be found standing erect.","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

""Bí baálẹ̀-ẹ́ bá ńtàkìtì, òrógi là ḿbá ẹmẹsẹ̀.""

## Translation
""If the head of the household is dancing energetically, one discusses serious matters with the house post/pillar.""

## Explanation
This proverb speaks to the importance of timing and context when addressing serious matters. When the head of the household (baálẹ̀) is in a celebratory mood or dancing (tàkìtì), it suggests they're not in the right frame of mind for serious discussions. In such moments, you might as well talk to the house post (òrógi) rather than trying to engage them in important matters.

The proverb teaches wisdom about:
1. Understanding appropriate timing for important conversations
2. Recognizing when authority figures are not receptive to serious matters
3. The futility of trying to discuss important issues with someone who is distracted or in a different mental state

It reflects the Yoruba cultural value of respecting proper context and timing for different types of interactions, especially when dealing with authority figures."
RAG,Anthropic,Afínjú wọ ọjà ó rìn gbẹndẹ́kẹ ọ̀bún wọ ọjà ó rìn ṣùẹ̀ṣùẹ̀; ọ̀bùn ní ó ru ẹrù afínjú relé.,The fashionable person enters the market and walks in a leisurely manner; the filthy person enters the market and walks in a sluggish manner; it is the filthy person that will carry the fashionable person's load to the house for him or her.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Translation:** ""The fashionable person enters the market walking proudly/majestically, the dirty/unkempt person enters the market walking slowly/carefully; it is the dirty person who ends up carrying the fashionable person's load home.""

**Explanation:** 
This proverb highlights the contrast between appearance and actual usefulness or functionality. The ""afínjú"" (fashionable or elegant person) makes a grand entrance with an impressive gait (""gbẹndẹ́kẹ"" - walking majestically), focused on looking good and being noticed. Meanwhile, the ""ọ̀bún"" (dirty or unkempt person) enters modestly and quietly (""ṣùẹ̀ṣùẹ̀"" - slowly/carefully).

The irony and lesson come in the second part: despite the fashionable person's grand display, it's the humble, unkempt person who provides the practical service of carrying the load. This proverb teaches that:

1. Appearance can be deceiving
2. Those who show off may not be the most useful or hardworking
3. Sometimes the unassuming people are the ones who get the real work done
4. Substance matters more than style

It's a caution against judging people's worth solely by their appearance or social status."
RAG,Anthropic,"Aáyán ati eèràá ṣígun, wọ́n ní àwọ́n ńlọ mú adìẹ àlọ la rí, a ò rábọ̀.","Cockroach and ant make ready for war and say they are off to capture chicken; we see their departure, but not their return.","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Translation:** ""The cockroach and the ant set out on an expedition; they said they were going to catch a hen, but we only witnessed their departure, not their return.""

**Explanation:** 
This proverb speaks about people who boast about undertaking ambitious tasks that clearly exceed their capabilities. The image of tiny insects (cockroach and ant) claiming they will capture something as large as a hen is deliberately absurd. It highlights those who make grand declarations and promises but never deliver results.

The proverb is used when someone talks big about what they intend to accomplish, but their goals are unrealistic given their resources or abilities. It serves as a caution against empty boasting and reminds us to be realistic about our capabilities.

In Yoruba culture, this saying might be used to gently mock someone who has made exaggerated claims but failed to follow through, or to warn against embarking on obviously impossible ventures."
RAG,Anthropic,Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ò mẹ̀yẹ.,A pig does not know what is becoming.,"# Yoruba Proverb Translation & Explanation

The proverb ""Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ò mẹ̀yẹ"" translates to:

**""The pig does not know beauty/elegance.""**

**Literal translation:**
- Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ = pig
- ò = does not
- mẹ̀yẹ = know beauty/elegance

**Explanation:**
This proverb speaks to the idea that someone who lacks refinement or class cannot recognize or appreciate beauty or elegance. A pig, which typically wallows in mud and filth, has no concept of what it means to be beautiful or refined.

The proverb is used to describe someone who lacks taste or aesthetic sensibility, yet attempts to judge matters of beauty or elegance. It suggests that certain qualities can only be recognized by those who possess or understand those qualities themselves.

This connects to the similar proverb you listed: ""Ẹlẹ́dẹ̀ ńpàfọ̀, ó rò pé òún ńṣoge"" which means ""A pig wallows in mud and thinks it's being fashionable"" - both highlight the disconnect between uncultured behavior and the understanding of refinement."
RAG,Anthropic,"Ẹ̀wọ̀n tó tó ọ̀pẹ ò tó-ó dá erin dúró; ìtàkùn tó ní kí erin má ròkè ọ̀dàn, tòun terin ní ńlọ.",A chain as thick as a palm-tree cannot stop an elephant; the vine that proposes to stop the elephant from going to the grassland will go with the elephant.,"# Translation and Explanation

**Literal Translation:**
""A chain that is as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant; the rope that says the elephant should not climb the ọ̀dàn tree, both the rope and the elephant will go together.""

**Meaning:**
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the futility of attempting to restrain someone or something that is far more powerful than the restraint itself. When a small force tries to restrict a much greater force, the result is that the restraint simply gets carried along with the greater power.

**Cultural Context:**
The proverb uses imagery familiar in Yoruba culture - the tall palm tree (ọ̀pẹ), the mighty elephant (erin), and the ọ̀dàn tree. It contrasts the seemingly impressive height of a chain with the much greater power of an elephant, showing that even what appears substantial (a chain as tall as a palm tree) is inadequate against true strength.

**Application:**
This proverb is used to caution against attempting to control forces beyond one's capacity. It can apply to situations where:
- Someone tries to restrict a person with much greater influence or power
- A weak policy or rule is applied to a strong-willed individual
- Any attempt to limit something using inadequate means

The wisdom advises understanding the true measure of forces at play before attempting restraint."
RAG,Anthropic,"Àfòpiná tó ní òun ó pa fìtílà, ara ẹ̀ ni yó pa.",The moth that attempts to kill (put out) the oil lamp will kill itself.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Àfòpiná tó ní òun ó pa fìtílà, ara ẹ̀ ni yó pa.""

**Translation:**
""The moth that says it will extinguish the lamp will end up killing itself.""

**Explanation:**
This Yoruba proverb uses the natural phenomenon of moths being attracted to light as a metaphor. Moths often fly toward flames or bright lights and can get burned or killed as a result. 

The proverb warns against overestimating one's abilities or challenging forces far greater than oneself. It suggests that when someone threatens to destroy or overcome something that is inherently more powerful than they are, they will likely end up harming themselves instead.

In broader cultural context, this proverb teaches humility and caution, warning against hubris or taking on challenges beyond one's capacity. It's a reminder that sometimes our own aggression or overconfidence can lead to our downfall, especially when we fail to recognize the true power of what we're confronting."
RAG,Anthropic,"Àgbàlagbà akàn tó kó sí garawa yègèdè, ojú tì í.",The elderly crab that enters into a bucket; it is thoroughly disgraced.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Proverb**: ""Àgbàlagbà akàn tó kó sí garawa yègèdè, ojú tì í.""

**Literal Translation**: ""An elderly crab that crawls into a basket of bananas feels ashamed.""

**Meaning and Explanation**:
This proverb speaks to the embarrassment or shame that comes when an elder or respected person finds themselves in an inappropriate or undignified situation. The image is vivid - a mature crab (representing an elder) crawling among bananas (an unfitting place) creates a sense of misplacement and impropriety.

In Yoruba culture, elders are expected to maintain dignity and serve as examples of proper conduct. When they engage in behavior unbecoming of their status or age, it brings shame not only to themselves but potentially to the community.

The proverb teaches that with age and status comes responsibility to behave appropriately. It serves as a warning that one's actions should align with one's position in society, especially as one grows older and more respected."
RAG,Anthropic,A pè ọ́ lọ́mọ erín-màgbọn ò ńyọ̀; ìwọ pàápàá ló mì í?,"You are described as the child of the elephant that swallows coconuts, and you rejoice; are you the one who swallows coconuts?","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Translation:**
""You are called 'child of an elephant' and you're not proud; are you the one who swallowed it?""

**Explanation:**
This proverb is about being given an honorable or prestigious title but failing to appreciate it. The humor comes from the absurd notion that someone might have ""swallowed"" an elephant rather than being its offspring.

The proverb criticizes someone who is given a compliment or prestigious association (being called a child of the mighty elephant) but shows no pride or appreciation for this honor. The rhetorical question at the end (""are you the one who swallowed it?"") emphasizes the absurdity of not appreciating such a significant title.

The proverb teaches that one should appreciate and be grateful for honors, compliments, or prestigious associations rather than showing indifference or ingratitude. It encourages people to recognize and value their positive connections and heritage."
RAG,Anthropic,Olówó ní ḿbá ọlọ́rọ̀-ọ́ rìn; ẹgbẹ́ ní ḿbá ẹgbẹ́ ṣeré.,It is a rich person that keeps company with a wealthy person; only people of equal standing play together.,"# Translation and Explanation

The Yoruba proverb ""Olówó ní ḿbá ọlọ́rọ̀-ọ́ rìn; ẹgbẹ́ ní ḿbá ẹgbẹ́ ṣeré"" translates to:

""The wealthy person walks with the affluent; peers play with peers.""

## Explanation:
This proverb speaks to the natural tendency for people to associate with others of similar social standing or circumstances. The first part references how wealthy people (""olówó"") tend to socialize with other wealthy or affluent people (""ọlọ́rọ̀""). The second part reinforces this concept by stating that peers or equals (""ẹgbẹ́"") play or socialize with their own kind.

The proverb highlights the social reality that people generally gravitate toward those who share similar status, experiences, or backgrounds. It acknowledges the natural social stratification that occurs in communities and how people seek companionship among those with whom they share commonalities.

This wisdom teaches about social dynamics and can serve as both an observation of human behavior and a reminder about the importance of finding one's appropriate social circle."
RAG,Anthropic,Kí ẹrú mọ ara ẹ̀ lẹ́rú; kí ìwọ̀fà mọ ara ẹ̀ níwọ̀fà; kí ọmọlúwàbí mọ ara ẹ̀ lẹ́rú Ọlọ́run ọba.,Let the slave know him/herself as a slave; let the pawn know him/herself as a pawn; let the well born person know him/herself as the child of God.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:**
""Let the slave know themselves as a slave; let the pawn know themselves as a pawn; let the well-behaved person know themselves as God the king's slave.""

**Meaning:**
This proverb speaks about self-awareness and understanding one's position in society. It emphasizes that everyone, regardless of social status, should recognize their true place:

1. The slave should acknowledge their status as a slave
2. The pawn (someone working to pay off a debt) should recognize their position
3. Even a person of good character (ọmọlúwàbí) should humble themselves as a servant of God

**Cultural context:**
In traditional Yoruba society, this proverb teaches humility and self-awareness. It suggests that regardless of social standing, everyone ultimately answers to a higher power. The well-mannered person's acknowledgment of being ""God's slave"" shows that even respected individuals should remain humble.

The proverb encourages people to understand their roles and limitations, avoid arrogance, and recognize that we all serve something greater than ourselves. It's about maintaining proper perspective about one's place in the social and spiritual order."
RAG,Anthropic,A kì í gbọ́n ju ẹni tí a máa dÍfá fún.,One cannot be wiser than the person for whom one will consult the Ifá oracle.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""A kì í gbọ́n ju ẹni tí a máa dÍfá fún""

## Translation
""One should not be wiser than the person for whom one is consulting the Ifá oracle.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the relationship between an advisor (such as a babalawo or Ifá priest) and the person seeking advice. It cautions against assuming superiority over someone you're meant to help.

The proverb uses the context of Ifá divination, a traditional Yoruba spiritual practice where a priest consults the oracle to provide guidance. In this relationship, while the diviner has knowledge, they shouldn't be condescending or think themselves intellectually superior to their client.

The deeper wisdom is about humility in advisory roles - whether as a counselor, teacher, or guide. It reminds us that providing guidance requires respect and acknowledging that the person seeking help has their own wisdom and agency in applying the advice they receive.

This proverb teaches the importance of respectful counsel without presuming to know better than those we serve."
RAG,Anthropic,Kí ni wọ́n ti ńṣe Àmọ́dù nÍlọrin? Ewúrẹ́ ńjẹ́ bẹ́ẹ̀.,What use do the people of Ilorin have for Ahmadu? Even goats are so named.,"# Translation and Explanation

**Literal translation:** ""What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat is eating the same way.""

**Meaning:** This proverb points out that people often worry about others facing challenges in distant places while similar problems exist right in front of them. It highlights the irony of being concerned about someone else's situation when the same issue is happening in your own environment.

The proverb uses a rhetorical question about someone named Amodu in Ilorin (a Nigerian city), followed by pointing out that a goat nearby is experiencing the same treatment or situation. It teaches about the human tendency to focus on distant problems while ignoring similar issues closer to home.

This reflects the universal wisdom about people often being more interested in distant matters than addressing immediate concerns in their own surroundings - similar to the English saying ""The grass is always greener on the other side."""
RAG,Anthropic,A-dá-má-lè-ṣe àdàbà tí ńdún bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀.,Start-something-it-cannot-finish dove that makes bombastic noises.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""A-dá-má-lè-ṣe àdàbà tí ńdún bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀""

## Translation
""The dove that coos 'bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀' is the one that is incapable of action.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb refers to a person who only talks loudly or boasts but cannot back up their words with action. The phrase ""A-dá-má-lè-ṣe"" means ""one who creates but cannot accomplish"" or ""one who cannot do what they claim,"" while ""àdàbà tí ńdún bẹ̀m̀bẹ̀"" refers to a dove making a distinctive cooing sound.

The proverb criticizes people who are all talk and no action - those who make a lot of noise about what they will do but never actually follow through. It's similar to English expressions like ""all bark and no bite"" or ""empty vessels make the most noise.""

In Yoruba culture, this proverb serves as a warning against idle boasting and encourages people to let their actions speak rather than just their words."
RAG,Anthropic,A-lu-dùndún kì í dárin.,The dùndún player does not lead a song.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""A-lu-dùndún kì í dárin""

## Translation
""One who plays the dundun drum does not randomly create music/songs.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the expertise and deliberation required in specialized roles. The dundun is a traditional Yoruba talking drum, and its player doesn't just strike the drum randomly - they follow established rhythms, patterns, and techniques.

The deeper meaning suggests that experts in any field don't act arbitrarily or make decisions without foundation. Their actions, though they might seem spontaneous to outsiders, are actually guided by knowledge, experience, and tradition. This proverb emphasizes the importance of proper training, knowledge of conventions, and respect for established practices before one can effectively innovate or perform.

It's similar to saying that true mastery involves understanding the rules before you can appear to break them effortlessly."
RAG,Anthropic,Aláṣọ-kan kì í ná ànárẹ.,A person who has only one set of clothing does not bargain until he is wet.,"# Translation of ""Aláṣọ-kan kì í ná ànárẹ""

**Literal translation:** ""A person with only one cloth does not hang it out to dry in the dew/early morning.""

**Meaning:** This Yoruba proverb teaches about resource management and caution when you have limited resources. When someone only owns a single piece of clothing, they cannot afford to leave it exposed to the early morning dew to dry, as they would have nothing else to wear in the meantime.

**Explanation:** This proverb emphasizes the need for prudence when dealing with limited resources. It advises against risking your only valuable possession or option. In Yoruba culture, this proverb counsels people to be careful with their limited resources and not to take unnecessary risks when they don't have alternatives or backups.

The proverb is similar to #2 in your list, which likely warns against playing in the rain when you only have one set of clothes, following the same principle of protecting limited resources."
RAG,Anthropic,Ọjọ́ àgbà-á kú sàn ju ọjọ́ àgbà-á tẹ́.,The day an elder dies is far better than the day an elder is disgraced.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Proverb**: ""Ọjọ́ àgbà-á kú sàn ju ọjọ́ àgbà-á tẹ́.""

**Translation**: ""The day an elder dies is better than the day an elder becomes disgraced/senile.""

**Explanation**:
This proverb speaks to the importance of dignity and respect in Yoruba culture, particularly regarding elders. It suggests that it is better for an elder to die with their honor and dignity intact than to live and suffer the shame of disgrace or the indignity of mental deterioration.

In Yoruba society, elders are highly revered and respected for their wisdom and experience. Their status comes with honor and dignity. This proverb reflects the cultural value that maintaining one's honor until death is preferable to losing one's dignity, respect, or mental faculties in old age.

The proverb teaches about the importance of living honorably and the value of dignity over mere existence. It also acknowledges the painful reality that sometimes death can be more merciful than living through certain forms of suffering or humiliation."
RAG,Anthropic,Ẹyẹ ò lè rí omi inú àgbọn bù mu.,A bird cannot get at the liquid inside a coconut to drink.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Ẹyẹ ò lè rí omi inú àgbọn bù mu.""

## Translation
""A bird cannot drink water from inside a coconut.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the concept of limitations and inaccessibility. The proverb describes how a bird, despite being able to fly and access many places, cannot reach the water inside a coconut due to the hard shell and narrow opening.

The deeper meaning relates to natural limitations and boundaries. Some things remain inaccessible to certain people despite their abilities or efforts. It can be used to describe situations where someone is trying to access resources, information, or opportunities that are structurally unavailable to them.

The proverb teaches about recognizing one's limitations and understanding that some goals may be unattainable due to natural barriers or circumstances beyond one's control, rather than due to lack of effort or ability."
RAG,Anthropic,“Mo mọ̀-ọ́ tán” lOrò-ó fi ńgbé ọkùnrin.,“I know it all” is the reason for Orò's carrying a man away.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

The proverb: ""Mo mọ̀-ọ́ tán"" lOrò-ó fi ńgbé ọkùnrin.

## Translation
""It is when a man says 'I know it all' that Oro (the deity) carries him away.""

## Explanation
This proverb is a warning against overconfidence and arrogance. In Yoruba traditional belief, Oro is a powerful and feared deity associated with ancestral spirits and secret societies. The proverb suggests that when a person becomes so confident that they believe they have nothing more to learn (""I know it all""), they become vulnerable to spiritual dangers or misfortune (symbolized by being carried away by Oro).

The deeper meaning conveys that excessive pride in one's knowledge often precedes a fall. It warns against intellectual arrogance and encourages humility and continued learning. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would be used to caution someone who is acting too confident or refusing to take advice from others.

The lesson is that no matter how knowledgeable we become, we should always maintain humility and recognize there is always more to learn."
RAG,Anthropic,Nígbàtí à ńto ọkà a ò to ti ẹmọ́ si.,When we were stacking the corn we did not stack some for the brown rat.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Nígbàtí à ńto ọkà a ò to ti ẹmọ́ si""

## Translation
""When we are gathering corn, we don't gather palm kernels as well.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb teaches about focus, prioritization, and the importance of completing one task before starting another. It uses the practical example of harvesting: when one is harvesting corn (ọkà), it's not the appropriate time to simultaneously gather palm kernels (ẹmọ́).

The wisdom in this proverb advises against dividing attention between multiple tasks at once, which could lead to inefficiency or poor results in both endeavors. It encourages people to concentrate on one important task and see it through to completion before moving on to another task.

In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to counsel someone who is trying to do too many things at once, or to remind someone to maintain focus on their current priority rather than being distracted by other opportunities or responsibilities."
RAG,Anthropic,"Àbúrò rẹ ńdáṣọ fún ọ, o ní o ò lo elékuru; ta ní ńlo alákàrà?","Your junior brother (or sister) buys clothing for you, and you say you will not wear anything with bean-grits patterns; who has the right to opt for clothing with a bean-fritter patterns?","# Translation and Explanation

The Yoruba proverb ""Àbúrò rẹ ńdáṣọ fún ọ, o ní o ò lo elékuru; ta ní ńlo alákàrà?"" translates to:

""Your younger sibling is sewing clothes for you, and you say you don't patronize bean cake sellers; who then patronizes bean fritter sellers?""

## Explanation:
This proverb speaks to the inconsistency and ingratitude in human behavior. If you refuse to accept help or patronage from someone close to you (like a family member making clothes for you), yet you expect to receive help or patronage from strangers or those less connected to you, you're being illogical and ungrateful.

The proverb uses food vendors as a metaphor - ""elékuru"" (bean cake seller) represents someone close offering help, while ""alákàrà"" (bean fritter seller) represents someone more distant. The message is that if you reject assistance from those closest to you, you have no logical basis to expect assistance from others who have less obligation to help you.

This proverb teaches about appreciating help from family, avoiding ingratitude, and recognizing the inconsistency in rejecting close relationships while seeking more distant ones."
RAG,Anthropic,"Bí kò sí tọ̀bùn èèyàn, ta ni ìbá jí lówùúrọ̀ tí kò bọ́jú ṣáṣá?","But for a person of filthy habits, who would wake in the morning and not wash his or her face clean?","# Translation and Explanation

**Literal translation:** ""If there weren't problems for humans, who would wake up in the morning and not wash their face properly?""

**Meaning explanation:** This Yoruba proverb suggests that difficulties and challenges are what motivate people to take proper care of themselves and be vigilant. It implies that without problems or troubles to worry about, people might become careless or negligent.

The proverb uses the morning face-washing routine as a metaphor - something everyone normally does carefully. It suggests that facing challenges makes us more attentive and disciplined in life, while comfort might lead to laziness or carelessness.

In broader context, it conveys the wisdom that adversity serves a purpose in human life by keeping us alert and making us take necessary precautions. Without challenges, we might become complacent and fail to properly prepare ourselves for life's demands."
RAG,Anthropic,Àpọ́nlé ni “İyá-a Káà”; ìyá kan ò sí ní káà tí kò lórúkọ.,Calling a person “Mother of the Compound” is only a mark of respect; there is no mother in the compound who does not have a name.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Àpọ́nlé ni ""İyá-a Káà""; ìyá kan ò sí ní káà tí kò lórúkọ.""

## Translation:
""'Mother of Káà' is a title of respect; there is no mother in a community who doesn't have a name/reputation.""

## Explanation:
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the importance of identity, reputation, and respect in the community. The proverb implies that every mother (or by extension, every person of significance) has their own identity and reputation in the community - they aren't anonymous or insignificant.

The term ""Àpọ́nlé"" refers to a title of honor or respect, suggesting that calling someone ""Mother of Káà"" (using their child's name as a way to identify them) is actually showing them honor rather than diminishing their individual identity.

The deeper meaning relates to how in traditional Yoruba communities, women may sometimes be known through their children's names (""Mother of so-and-so""), but this doesn't mean they lack their own identity or standing. Rather, it's an honorific that recognizes their important role as mothers while acknowledging they have their own reputation and place in society."
RAG,Anthropic,"Bí iná bá dun ọbẹ̀, a dá ọ̀rọ̀ sọ.","If the fire gets at the stew, the stew will burst into speech.","# Translation and Explanation of ""Bí iná bá dun ọbẹ̀, a dá ọ̀rọ̀ sọ""

## Translation
""When the fire/heat affects the soup, it stirs up conversation.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb describes how trouble or difficulty often prompts discussion or reveals truth. Just as soup that's being overcooked or burning on the fire will cause immediate reaction and conversation among those present, problems or uncomfortable situations tend to bring hidden issues to light.

The proverb speaks to how adversity often forces people to address matters they might otherwise avoid. When something goes wrong (the soup burning), people can no longer remain silent—they must speak up and address the situation directly.

This is similar to the other proverbs you shared, which also deal with how circumstances affect communication: the second refers to how a thief's mother cannot speak comfortably about certain topics, and the third suggests that when eyes witness something, the mouth becomes quiet (in shock or because evidence speaks for itself)."
RAG,Anthropic,Àṣejù baba àṣetẹ́; ẹ̀tẹ́ ní ńgbẹ̀hìn àṣejù; àgbàlagbà tó wẹ̀wù àṣejù ẹ̀tẹ́ ni yó fi rí.,Lack of moderation is the father of disgrace; disgrace comes of immoderation; a grown person who clothes himself in immoderation will find disgrace.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Translation:**
""Excess is the father of shame; shame is the end result of excess; an elder who wears the garment of excess will end up in shame.""

**Explanation:**
This Yoruba proverb warns against excessiveness or going to extremes in behavior, actions, or lifestyle. It teaches that:

1. Excess (àṣejù) directly leads to shame or disgrace (àṣetẹ́)
2. The natural consequence of excessive behavior is embarrassment
3. Even respected elders (àgbàlagbà) who engage in excessive behaviors will ultimately face humiliation

The proverb emphasizes the universal principle that immoderate actions, regardless of one's status or age, will eventually lead to negative consequences. It promotes moderation, self-control, and dignified conduct as cultural values in Yoruba society.

This is a cautionary message about maintaining balance and restraint in all aspects of life to preserve one's honor and reputation."
RAG,Anthropic,Ọjọ́ kan ṣoṣo là ńtẹ́; ojoojúmọ́ lojú ńtini.,It takes one day only for one to disgrace oneself; the shame is a daily affair.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Ọjọ́ kan ṣoṣo là ńtẹ́; ojoojúmọ́ lojú ńtini.""

## Translation
""It takes only one day to become disgraced/shamed; the shame/embarrassment lasts every day.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to how quickly reputation can be damaged and how long-lasting the consequences of disgrace can be. It emphasizes that while it takes just a single moment of poor judgment or a single mistake to ruin one's reputation, the resulting shame and consequences continue indefinitely.

The proverb teaches about the importance of careful conduct and wise decision-making. It warns that the effects of disgrace aren't temporary but persist, affecting one's standing in the community long after the incident that caused it.

The related proverbs you provided reinforce this theme:
- ""Aláṣọ-kan kì í ṣeré òjò"" (A person with only one garment doesn't play in the rain) - speaks to avoiding risky behavior when you lack resources to recover
- ""Ọjọ́ kan là ḿbàjẹ́, ọjọ́ gbogbo lara ńtini"" (It takes one day to get spoiled, but the consequences affect you every day) - directly parallels the target proverb's message

This wisdom resonates across cultures with similar expressions about reputation taking years to build but only moments to destroy."
RAG,Anthropic,A kì í dákẹ́ ká ṣìwí; a kì í wò sùn-ùn ká dáràn.,One does not keep quiet and yet misspeak; one does not silently contemplate the world and yet get into trouble.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:** ""One does not keep silent and misspeak; one does not stare fixedly and be guilty of wrongdoing.""

**Meaning:** This proverb emphasizes that silence cannot be misinterpreted as saying the wrong thing, and mere observation cannot be considered a crime or offense. 

**Explanation:** The proverb teaches about the safety of restraint and observation. It suggests that:

1. If you remain silent, you cannot be accused of saying something inappropriate or offensive.
2. If you are simply observing a situation (looking on) without taking action, you cannot be held responsible for wrongdoing.

The wisdom here lies in recognizing that sometimes the safest course of action is non-action - neither speaking nor intervening. It counsels discretion and advises people to be mindful that active participation (through words or deeds) creates accountability, while observation and silence keep one free from blame.

This is similar to English expressions like ""Silence cannot be misquoted"" or ""You can't get in trouble for what you don't say."""
RAG,Anthropic,"Ṣe bóo ti mọ, ẹlẹ́wàa Ṣàpọ́n.","Moderate your preening and strutting, beautiful woman of Ṣàpọ́n.","# Translation and Explanation of ""Ṣe bóo ti mọ, ẹlẹ́wàa Ṣàpọ́n""

## Translation
""Do as you know (how to do), beautiful one of Ṣàpọ́n.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb is essentially advising someone to act according to their own knowledge or ability. The phrase ""ẹlẹ́wàa Ṣàpọ́n"" refers to a beautiful person from Ṣàpọ́n (a place name).

The proverb is used in contexts where someone is being encouraged to proceed with what they know how to do best, rather than attempting something unfamiliar or beyond their expertise. It acknowledges that each person has their own skills and knowledge, and they should stick to these rather than venturing into unknown territory where they might fail.

It's similar to English expressions like ""stick to what you know"" or ""play to your strengths."""
RAG,Anthropic,Gbogbo èèyàn ní ńsunkún-un Bánjọ; ṣùgbọ́n Bánjọ ò sunkún ara ẹ̀.,"Everybody laments Banjọ's fate, but Banjọ does not lament his own fate.","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

## Translation
""Everyone is crying for Banjo; but Banjo is not crying for himself.""

## Explanation
This proverb speaks to the irony of situations where outsiders may show more concern or distress about someone's circumstances than the person themselves. It highlights how people often worry about others who may actually be content or have accepted their situation.

The proverb teaches that we shouldn't be more troubled about someone's problems than they are themselves. It can apply to situations where:

1. People unnecessarily worry about others who have adapted to their circumstances
2. Someone shows resilience in the face of adversity while others pity them
3. Outsiders misunderstand someone's situation and assume it's worse than it actually is

In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to caution against excessive worry or meddling in others' affairs when they themselves seem at peace with their situation."
RAG,Anthropic,Idà ahun la fi ńpa ahun.,It is with its own sword that one kills the tortoise.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Idà ahun la fi ńpa ahun""

**Translation:**
""It is with the tortoise's sword that we kill the tortoise.""

**Explanation:**
This Yoruba proverb means that a person's own weapons, tools, or methods can be used against them. It suggests that the very things we create or possess as strengths can become our weaknesses when they are turned against us. 

The proverb uses the tortoise (ahun) as a metaphor - the tortoise is known for its protective shell and defensive qualities, yet the proverb suggests that even the tortoise's own defenses can be used to defeat it.

In practical terms, this wisdom applies when:
- Someone's own words are used to contradict them
- A person's tactics are studied and then used to outmaneuver them
- The very tools one creates become instruments of their downfall
- A person's strength, when overused, becomes a weakness

This proverb teaches us to be mindful that our own creations, methods, or characteristics can sometimes be turned against us."
RAG,Anthropic,Oúnjẹ ọmọ kékeré a máa wọ àgbà nínú; òrùka ọmọ kékeré ni kì í wọ ágbá lọ́wọ́.,A youth's food can enter the stomach of an elder; it is only a youth's ring that cannot slip unto an elder's finger.,"# Translation and Explanation

**Literal translation:** ""A child's food can fit into an elder's stomach; but a child's ring cannot fit onto an elder's finger.""

**Meaning:** This proverb highlights the difference between physical capacity and appropriateness of size. While an adult can easily consume a child's portion of food (as the adult's stomach is larger), a child's ring is physically too small for an adult's finger.

**Deeper meaning:** The proverb teaches about knowing your limits and understanding what is appropriate for your position or status. It suggests that while some things can be shared or transferred between people of different ages or status (like food), other things simply won't fit or be appropriate (like the ring). 

It's a lesson about recognizing natural limitations and not trying to force situations that are fundamentally incompatible. It could be applied to advise against adults adopting childish behaviors, or more broadly, to warn against attempting to force oneself into roles or situations that are inherently unsuitable."
RAG,Anthropic,“Ẹ fà á wọlé” ló yẹ ẹlẹ́ṣin.,“Lead it into the stable” is what becomes a horseman.,"# Translation and Explanation of """"Ẹ fà á wọlé"" ló yẹ ẹlẹ́ṣin""

**Literal Translation:**
""'Pull it into the house' is what befits the horse owner.""

**Meaning:**
This Yoruba proverb suggests that a person who owns a horse (or any valuable possession) should know the appropriate way to handle it - by bringing it safely inside rather than leaving it vulnerable outside. 

**Deeper Explanation:**
The proverb speaks to responsibility and proper stewardship. It teaches that when you have something valuable (symbolized by the horse), you must take appropriate steps to protect and secure it. The owner should not be negligent but should ensure the horse is properly sheltered and cared for.

**Application:**
In everyday life, this proverb advises people to take proper care of their assets, opportunities, relationships, or responsibilities. It suggests that having something valuable comes with the duty to manage it correctly - not just possessing it, but protecting and maintaining it appropriately.

The proverb emphasizes accountability and the wisdom of safeguarding what is valuable to you."
RAG,Anthropic,Ajá kì í lọ ságinjù lọ ṣọdẹ ẹkùn.,A dog does not go into the wild to hunt a leopard.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Ajá kì í lọ ságinjù lọ ṣọdẹ ẹkùn""

## Translation
""A dog does not go into the deep forest to hunt a tiger/leopard.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb conveys wisdom about knowing one's limitations and avoiding unnecessary risks. It uses the imagery of a dog (ajá) attempting to hunt a much larger and more dangerous predator (ẹkùn - tiger/leopard) in the deep forest (ságinjù).

The proverb teaches that one should not take on challenges that are clearly beyond their capacity or strength. Just as it would be foolish and dangerous for a dog to hunt a tiger, people should recognize their limitations and not engage in endeavors that would likely lead to their downfall.

This is similar to English sayings like ""Don't bite off more than you can chew"" or ""Know your limits."" It's a warning against overestimating one's abilities and a reminder to approach challenges with realistic expectations."
RAG,Anthropic,Alátiṣe ní ḿmọ àtiṣe ara-a rẹ̀.,The person who must settle his/her affair knows best how he/she plans to go about doing so.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Proverb**: ""Alátiṣe ní ḿmọ àtiṣe ara-a rẹ̀.""

**Literal Translation**: ""The person who has committed a misdeed knows their own wrongdoing.""

**Meaning**: This proverb suggests that the person who has done something wrong is fully aware of their actions and the nature of their offense. It conveys the idea that people who have committed errors or transgressions have an internal awareness of their guilt, even if they pretend otherwise.

**Cultural Context**: In Yoruba culture, this proverb is often used to remind people that conscience is a powerful force - those who have done wrong carry the knowledge of their actions with them. It's similar to the English expression ""the guilty mind needs no accuser"" or ""the guilty person knows their own guilt.""

**Usage**: This saying might be employed when someone denies wrongdoing but shows signs of guilt, or in situations where a community knows someone is responsible for a misdeed even without direct evidence. It emphasizes personal accountability and self-awareness regarding one's actions."
RAG,Anthropic,"Àpárá ńlá, ìjà ní ńdà.",Excessive ribbing unfailingly leads to a fight.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Àpárá ńlá, ìjà ní ńdà""

## Translation
""A large slap leads to a fight"" or ""A heavy slap inevitably causes a fight""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb warns about how excessive or disproportionate actions can escalate situations into conflicts. The proverb uses the imagery of a hard slap (àpárá ńlá) that, because of its severity, will naturally provoke retaliation and lead to a full-blown fight (ìjà).

The wisdom in this proverb lies in its counsel for moderation and appropriate response. It suggests that extreme actions or overreactions often trigger equally strong or even stronger counteractions. This applies to various contexts - from interpersonal relationships to community disputes and even international relations.

The proverb serves as a caution against excessive force or harshness, advising that proportionate responses help prevent unnecessary escalation of conflicts."
RAG,Anthropic,"Òní, ẹtú jìnfìn, ọ̀la, ẹtú jìnfìn; ẹtu nìkan lẹran tó wà nígbó?","Today, the antelope falls into the ditch; tomorrow, the antelope falls into the ditch; is the antelope the only animal in the forest?","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:** ""Today, duiker soup; tomorrow, duiker soup; is duiker the only animal in the forest?""

**Meaning:** This proverb criticizes monotony, lack of variety, or repeatedly choosing the same option when alternatives are available. The ""ẹtú"" (duiker/antelope) represents something that becomes tedious through constant repetition, despite many other options (other animals in the forest) being available.

**Cultural context:** In traditional Yoruba cuisine, bush meat from different animals provided variety in soups and stews. The proverb uses this food context to make a broader point about the importance of variety and exploring different options in life.

**Application:** This saying might be used when someone:
- Keeps telling the same stories
- Repeatedly uses the same approach to solve different problems
- Fails to explore alternatives when better options might exist
- Shows a lack of creativity or innovation when variety would be beneficial

The proverb encourages diversity of experience, thought, and action."
RAG,Anthropic,"Ìyàwó tó na ọmọ ọbàkan, ọ̀rọ̀ ló fẹ́ gbọ́.",The wife who whips a relative of her husband is asking for stern rebuke.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:**
""A wife who beats her stepchild is looking for something to hear (or wants to hear words).""

**Meaning:**
This proverb refers to a situation where a stepmother mistreats her stepchild. It suggests that when a wife or stepmother beats or mistreats her stepchild, she is essentially inviting confrontation or criticism from her husband (the child's father) or other family members.

**Cultural context:**
In traditional Yoruba society, family structures often included polygamous households where children might be raised by stepmothers. The proverb acknowledges the sometimes tense dynamics in such relationships while warning against mistreatment of stepchildren.

**Broader application:**
Beyond the literal family context, this proverb can be applied to any situation where someone mistreats someone under their care who is closely connected to others with authority. It suggests that such behavior will inevitably provoke a response or confrontation.

The proverb serves as a warning that actions have consequences, particularly when those actions involve mistreating vulnerable individuals who have protectors."
RAG,Anthropic,“Ọjọ́ tí mo ti ḿbọ̀ ng ò rírú ẹ̀ rí”: olúwa ẹ̀-ẹ́ mọ ìwọ̀n ara ẹ̀ ni.,“In all the days I have walked this earth I have never seen the like”: that person knows his place.,"# Translation and Explanation

**Literal Translation:**
""Since the day I was born, I have never seen such a thing"": the owner/master knows his own limits/worth.

**Meaning:**
This proverb is about self-awareness and knowing one's position or capabilities. It conveys that when someone exclaims ""I've never seen such a thing before!"" about someone else's behavior, it often indicates that the person in question is acting beyond their appropriate social standing or abilities.

The proverb suggests that everyone should understand their place in society, their capabilities, and their limitations. It cautions against overreaching or pretending to be what you are not. The true owner or master of something (or oneself) properly understands their own worth and limitations.

This is similar to the English sayings ""Know your place"" or ""Know your limits,"" but with the Yoruba cultural context of social hierarchy and proper behavior according to one's station in life."
RAG,Anthropic,"Àì-kúkú-joye, ó sàn ju, “Ẹnuù mi ò ká ìlú” lọ.","Not-assuming-the-position-of-ruler-at-all is far better than, “My word is not heeded by the people.”","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

The proverb ""Àì-kúkú-joye, ó sàn ju, 'Ẹnuù mi ò ká ìlú' lọ"" translates to:

""Not becoming king at all is better than saying, 'My reign did not benefit the town.'""

## Explanation:
This proverb teaches about leadership responsibility and legacy. It suggests that it's better to never hold a position of authority than to hold one and fail to make positive contributions. The wisdom here emphasizes that:

1. The purpose of leadership is to serve and improve the community
2. A leadership that brings no benefit is worse than no leadership at all
3. It's about the quality and impact of one's tenure, not merely occupying the position

The proverb reflects Yoruba values regarding responsible leadership and the importance of leaving a positive legacy rather than simply holding titles without meaningful contributions to the community."
RAG,Anthropic,À-wín-ná-wó ò yẹni; à-gbà-bọ̀-ọ ṣòkòtò ò yẹ ọmọ èèyàn; bí kò fúnni lẹ́sẹ̀ a dòrògí; ohun ẹni ní ńyẹni.,Borrowing-money-to-spend does not speak well of one; borrowed trousers do not become a person; if it is not tight around the legs it is difficult to remove; it is one's thing that fits one.,"# Translation and Explanation of Yoruba Proverb

**Translation:**
""Borrowed money doesn't suit one; borrowed trousers don't suit a person; if they don't fit your legs, they become awkward; one's own possession is what suits one.""

**Explanation:**
This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of self-ownership and the discomfort that comes with borrowing or using things that don't truly belong to you. It uses two parallel examples:

1. Borrowed money doesn't truly complement you
2. Borrowed trousers that don't fit properly become uncomfortable and awkward

The deeper meaning is that what truly fits and suits a person is what legitimately belongs to them. Things we borrow, whether material possessions or resources, often come with constraints or discomfort. This proverb teaches self-reliance and cautions against depending on borrowed things, suggesting that true dignity and comfort come from what one can genuinely call their own.

The proverb speaks to authenticity and self-sufficiency as cultural values in Yoruba wisdom."
RAG,Anthropic,Kí ni Dáàró ní kó tó sọ pé olè-é kó òun?,What did Dáàró own before he claimed he was robbed?,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Kí ni Dáàró ní kó tó sọ pé olè-é kó òun?""

## Translation
""What did Daaro have before claiming he was robbed?""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb is questioning what possessions Daaro actually owned before he started complaining about being robbed. The proverb is essentially asking: how can someone claim to have lost something if it's not clear they ever had it in the first place?

The proverb is used to challenge people who exaggerate their losses or complain about being deprived of things they never truly possessed. It's a way of questioning the credibility of someone's claims of victimhood or loss.

This is similar to proverb #2 in your list which expresses the same concept with slightly different wording. Both proverbs use the character ""Daaro"" as a rhetorical device to convey skepticism about unverified claims of loss.

The proverb teaches the importance of honesty and warns against false claims or exaggeration of one's possessions or losses."
RAG,Anthropic,"Ẹlẹ́ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́ ńlọ ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́, o ní “Ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́gbẹ̀ta ni àbí ẹ̀ẹ́dẹ́gbẹ̀fà?”; èwo lo gbé níbẹ̀?","A person says he has lost an unspecified amount of money, and you ask if the amount is five hundred cowries or eleven hundred cowries; which amount did you steal?","# Translation and Explanation

**Translation:** 
""The person going to the pig market asks, 'Is it five hundred pigs or six hundred pigs?'; which one did you take from there?""

**Explanation:**
This Yoruba proverb is making fun of someone who boasts or asks questions about things they haven't yet accomplished. The person is talking about how many pigs they'll buy (asking whether there are 500 or 600 pigs available), yet they haven't even purchased a single one.

The proverb mocks those who count their chickens before they hatch or who pretend to be knowledgeable about matters they have no real experience with. The final question ""which one did you take from there?"" highlights the irony - the person hasn't taken any pigs at all, making their detailed questions about quantities meaningless.

It serves as a warning against premature boasting or speculation before actually achieving something concrete."
RAG,Anthropic,Ojú kì í pọ́n baálé ilé kó fọwọ́ gbálẹ̀ ilé ẹ̀.,A head of a household is never so hard up that he sweeps his compound with his bare hands.,"# Translation and Explanation

""Ojú kì í pọ́n baálé ilé kó fọwọ́ gbálẹ̀ ilé ẹ̀"" translates to:

""The head of the household does not become so poor/desperate that he has to sweep his own compound with his hands.""

## Explanation:
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the preservation of dignity and status even during difficult times. It suggests that no matter how financially desperate the head of a household becomes, certain tasks beneath their status (like sweeping the ground with bare hands rather than using a proper broom) remain inappropriate for them.

The proverb emphasizes the cultural understanding of maintaining social hierarchy and appropriate roles even during hardship. It relates to the concept of dignity in leadership positions and the importance of maintaining one's position and respect in the community despite challenges.

The other proverbs you shared follow a similar pattern, suggesting that no matter how desperate a diviner becomes, they shouldn't ask about yesterday's sacrifice, and no matter how hungry a monkey gets, it shouldn't eat dirt."
RAG,Anthropic,"“Ẹ kú-ulé” ò yẹ ará ilé; “Ẹ kú atìbà” ò yẹni tí ńtàjò bọ̀; ẹni tí ò kí ẹni, “Kú atìbà”-á pàdánù “Ẹ kú-ulé.”","“Greetings to you, house-bound ones” is improper for the house-bound to utter; “Welcome home” is not proper for the person arriving from a trip; whoever fails to give “welcome” to the person returning does himself or herself out of “greetings, house-bound.”","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Translation:**
""Welcome home"" is not appropriate for the house owner; ""Welcome visitor"" is not appropriate for someone returning from a journey; the person who doesn't greet someone with ""Welcome visitor"" will lose their own ""Welcome home.""

**Explanation:**
This proverb addresses proper greetings and social etiquette in Yoruba culture. It explains that:

1. You don't say ""Welcome home"" (Ẹ kú-ulé) to someone who is already at home, as it's only appropriate for returning residents.

2. You don't say ""Welcome visitor"" (Ẹ kú atìbà) to someone returning from a journey, as they aren't visitors but returning members.

3. Most importantly, the proverb warns that if you fail to properly greet others with appropriate recognition (not greeting visitors as visitors), you'll eventually lose the courtesy of being properly welcomed yourself when you return home.

The deeper meaning teaches reciprocity in social relationships - how you treat others determines how they'll treat you in return. It emphasizes the importance of using contextually appropriate greetings and showing proper respect according to Yoruba customs."
RAG,Anthropic,Ẹran kí la ò jẹ rí? Ọ̀pọ̀lọ́ báni lábàtà ó ba búrúbúrú.,"What sort of meat is it, the likes of which one has never tasted? A toad comes upon one at the swamp and cowers in fright.","# Translation and Explanation

**Literal translation:** ""What meat have we not eaten before? The frog met us wearing shoes, but now it's naked/unadorned.""

**Meaning:** This proverb expresses the idea that we should not be surprised by changes in fortune or circumstances. It uses the humorous image of a frog that was once wearing shoes (representing prosperity or high status) but is now seen in its natural, unadorned state.

**Explanation:** The proverb teaches about the impermanence of status and wealth. It suggests that one should not be shocked when someone who was once prosperous falls on hard times, or when something that seemed impressive is revealed to be ordinary. It encourages people to maintain perspective about life's ups and downs, recognizing that circumstances often change. The saying also implies that we've experienced many things in life (""what meat have we not eaten?""), so we shouldn't be surprised by reversals of fortune.

This proverb is often used when discussing someone who has fallen from a position of wealth or status, or when something that appeared special is revealed to be common."
RAG,Anthropic,A-binú-fùfù ní ńwá oúnjẹ fún a-binú-wẹ́rẹ́-wẹ́rẹ́.,A volatile-tempered person secures food for a mild-tempered person.,"# Translation and Explanation

**Literal translation:**
""The one who gets angry and puffs up is the one who looks for food for the one who gets mildly angry.""

**Meaning:**
This Yoruba proverb contrasts two types of angry people - the one who shows intense, dramatic anger (fùfù - puffing up) versus the one whose anger is milder or more restrained (wẹ́rẹ́-wẹ́rẹ́ - mild/gentle).

The proverb suggests that the person who makes a big show of their anger often ends up working for or serving those who maintain composure. The dramatic person expends so much energy on emotional displays that they actually end up in a position of providing for or working to benefit the calmer person.

It teaches that excessive emotional reactions often lead to disadvantageous positions, while those who control their temper tend to benefit. This proverb encourages emotional restraint and warns against letting anger drive one to impulsive or dramatic behavior that ultimately works against one's own interests."
RAG,Anthropic,"Pẹ̀tẹ̀pẹ́tẹ̀ Ìjèṣà, ó ta sẹ́ni lára kò wọ́n.",The mud of the Ìjèṣà: it splashes on one and will not be washed off.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:**
""The Ijesha mud/clay splashes on someone's body, it's not expensive.""

**Meaning and explanation:**
This proverb refers to the idea that when mud from Ijesha land splashes on someone, it doesn't cost anything or cause serious harm. The deeper meaning relates to situations where someone causes minor offense or inconvenience to another person but doesn't consider it significant or worth apologizing for.

The proverb serves as a critique of inconsiderate behavior - it points out how people might dismiss the discomfort they cause others simply because it doesn't affect them personally or because they don't value the other person's feelings.

It teaches about empathy and consideration - what seems insignificant to the person causing harm (the mud splasher) might be quite bothersome to the recipient (the person getting splashed).

This proverb is used to remind people to be mindful of how their actions affect others, even in seemingly small ways."
RAG,Anthropic,Ta ní ńjẹun tájá ńjùrù?,At whose dinner table is the dog wagging its tail?,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Ta ní ńjẹun tájá ńjùrù?""

## Translation
""Who is eating while the dog is staring/watching intensely?""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb describes a situation where someone is eating while a dog is staring longingly at the food. In Yoruba culture, this proverb is used to highlight the uncomfortable or awkward feeling that comes when someone enjoys something in the presence of others who clearly desire or need the same thing but have no access to it.

The proverb speaks to social awareness and sensitivity. It suggests that it is inconsiderate or inappropriate to enjoy privileges, resources, or benefits without acknowledging or sharing with those in need around you. The staring dog represents the person in need who is watching someone else enjoy what they lack.

This proverb teaches empathy and consideration for others' circumstances, encouraging sharing and social responsibility rather than consuming or enjoying things selfishly while others go without."
RAG,Anthropic,Afínjú ní ńjẹ iwọ; ọ̀mọ̀ràn ní ńjẹ obì; màrí-màjẹ ní ńjẹ awùsá.,It is a finicky person that eats iwọ;,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

""Afínjú ní ńjẹ iwọ; ọ̀mọ̀ràn ní ńjẹ obì; màrí-màjẹ ní ńjẹ awùsá.""

**Translation:**
""It is the elegant/fastidious person who eats the floating 'iwo' food; it is the knowledgeable/wise person who eats kola nut; it is the ignorant/impulsive person who eats 'awusa' (tiger nuts).""

**Explanation:**
This proverb speaks to how different character traits determine one's choices or privileges in life:

1. ""Afínjú"" refers to a person who is refined, elegant, or fastidious in their choices. Such a person chooses the delicate ""iwo"" (a type of food that floats in soup).

2. ""Ọ̀mọ̀ràn"" refers to a wise or knowledgeable person who appreciates the cultural significance of kola nuts, which are traditionally valued in Yoruba culture for ceremonies and important occasions.

3. ""Màrí-màjẹ"" describes someone who lacks discernment or acts impulsively, eating tiger nuts without consideration.

The deeper meaning is that one's character, wisdom, and discernment determine what one values and chooses in life. It emphasizes the importance of refinement and wisdom in making choices, suggesting that our preferences and what we consume (literally or metaphorically) reveal our character and level of understanding."
RAG,Anthropic,"Bí a kò bá tó ìyà-á kọ̀ tí à ńkọ̀ ọ́, àjẹkún ìyà là ńjẹ.","If one lacks the means to reject suffering and attempts to reject it, one's suffering simply multiplies.","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Proverb**: ""Bí a kò bá tó ìyà-á kọ̀ tí à ńkọ̀ ọ́, àjẹkún ìyà là ńjẹ.""

**Direct Translation**: ""If one is not capable of rejecting the suffering that one is rejecting, one will suffer endless suffering.""

**Meaning**: This proverb teaches that if you try to avoid responsibilities, challenges, or necessary hardships that you're not actually in a position to avoid, you'll end up facing even greater suffering or hardship as a consequence.

**Cultural Context**: In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb emphasizes the importance of facing necessary challenges head-on rather than attempting to escape them when escape isn't truly possible. It suggests that avoiding inevitable responsibilities only postpones and magnifies the eventual difficulties.

**Application**: This proverb might be used to advise someone who is trying to shirk necessary duties, avoid learning important life skills, or escape the natural consequences of their actions. It teaches that accepting necessary hardship now is better than facing greater suffering later."
RAG,Anthropic,A kì í bọ òrìṣà lójú ọ̀fọ́n-ọ̀n; bó bá dalẹ́ a máa tú pẹpẹ.,"One does not sacrifice to a god in the presence of a house rat; otherwise, when night falls it invades the rafter shelves.","# Translation and Explanation

**Literal translation**: ""One does not worship a deity during a time of scarcity/harmattan; when the time of plenty comes, one will spread out an altar/make offerings.""

**Meaning**: This proverb advises against making sacrifices or worship only during difficult times. It suggests that true devotion isn't shown only during hardship but should continue (and can be more generous) when prosperity returns.

**Cultural context**: The proverb uses the concept of ""ọ̀fọ́n-ọ̀n"" (harmattan - the dry, dusty season) as a metaphor for scarcity or hard times. In Yoruba traditional religion, worship of òrìṣà (deities) often involves offerings. The proverb cautions against being a fair-weather worshipper who only remembers spiritual obligations during difficulties but forgets them in good times.

**Modern application**: This wisdom extends beyond religious practice to relationships and commitments in general - one shouldn't only seek help during hardship but maintain connections and obligations during prosperous times as well."
RAG,Anthropic,Ìwọ̀sí ní,X,"The phrase ""Ìwọ̀sí ní"" is somewhat incomplete as presented, which makes it difficult to translate directly. Based on my knowledge of Yoruba proverbs, this appears to be a shortened form of a longer expression.

The most likely complete form would be something like ""Ìwọ̀sí ní ǹkan ńlọ"" which would translate to ""Things are moving/trending toward Iwosi"" or ""The direction is toward Iwosi.""

In Yoruba culture, this proverb is typically used to indicate that a situation is taking a particular direction or trend. ""Ìwọ̀sí"" refers to a direction or location (potentially a place name), and the expression suggests movement toward that direction.

The proverb is often used to comment on the obvious direction a matter is taking, especially when people might be pretending not to notice the trend. It can be used to point out that the outcome of a situation is becoming increasingly clear.

In contemporary usage, it might be equivalent to saying ""It's clear which way the wind is blowing"" or ""The writing is on the wall."""
RAG,Anthropic,Àgbà tí kò lẹ́sẹ̀ nílẹ̀ a lọ́gbọ́n nínú.,An elder that has no substance should have cunning.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Àgbà tí kò lẹ́sẹ̀ nílẹ̀ a lọ́gbọ́n nínú""

## Translation
""An elder who doesn't have a foothold on the ground has wisdom inside.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the relationship between physical ability and mental capacity. It suggests that an elder who may be physically weak, immobile, or unable to stand firmly (""doesn't have a foothold on the ground"") compensates with inner wisdom or intelligence.

The proverb acknowledges that as people age and lose physical strength, they often gain wisdom through their accumulated life experiences. It recognizes that value comes in different forms - while the elder may not contribute physical labor, their wisdom and guidance are equally important contributions to society.

This reflects the Yoruba cultural respect for elders as repositories of knowledge and wisdom, even when their physical capabilities diminish with age."
RAG,Anthropic,"À ńjá ìbàǹtẹ́ ẹ̀ lẹ́hìn, ó ńjá tará iwájú.","His loincloth is being stripped from behind, yet he is stripping those of the people ahead of him.","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:** ""While one tears the cloth from behind, another tears it from the front.""

**Meaning:** This proverb describes a situation where people are working at cross-purposes or undermining each other's efforts, often unknowingly. It illustrates how uncoordinated actions, even when intended to help, can lead to greater damage or problems.

**Cultural context:** In traditional Yoruba society, cloth (ìbàntẹ́) is valuable and represents status and wealth. The image of people tearing it from different directions vividly illustrates wasteful or counterproductive behavior.

**Application:** This proverb is used to advise on the importance of coordination, communication, and working together toward common goals. It warns against situations where lack of coordination between people or groups leads to wasted efforts or even making situations worse.

**Similar English expressions:** ""The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing"" or ""Working at cross-purposes."""
RAG,Anthropic,"Ẹ̀yá ló bí mi, ẹkùn ló wò mí dàgbà, ológìnní gbà mí tọ́; bí kò sẹ́ran lọ́bẹ̀ nkò jẹ.","I was born of a monkey; I was raised by a leopard, I was adopted by a cat; if there is no meat in the stew I will not eat it.","# Translation and Explanation

""Ẹ̀yá ló bí mi, ẹkùn ló wò mí dàgbà, ológìnní gbà mí tọ́; bí kò sẹ́ran lọ́bẹ̀ nkò jẹ.""

**Translation:**
""The monkey gave birth to me, the leopard raised me, the cat adopted me; if there is no meat in the stew, I will not eat it.""

**Explanation:**
This proverb speaks to the influence of upbringing on one's character and habits. It metaphorically describes someone raised among carnivorous animals (leopard, cat) who has developed a strong preference that cannot be changed. The person has been so thoroughly influenced by their environment that they've developed particular tastes or standards (needing meat in their stew) that they refuse to compromise on.

The deeper meaning relates to how our background and the influences in our life shape our preferences, standards, and character. It suggests that a person's habits and preferences are deeply ingrained based on their upbringing and environment, and they may be unwilling to settle for less than what they're accustomed to.

This proverb might be used when describing someone who maintains high standards due to their background or when explaining why someone has particular preferences that seem uncompromising to others."
RAG,Anthropic,"À-jẹ-tán, à-jẹ-ì-mọra, ká fi ọwọ́ mẹ́wẹ̀ẹ̀wá jẹun ò yẹ ọmọ èèyàn.","Eating-absolutely-everything, eating-with-abandon, eating with all ten fingers is unworthy of human beings.","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Translation:**
""Eating until it's finished, eating without control, eating with ten fingers - these are not befitting of a human being.""

**Explanation:**
This Yoruba proverb emphasizes proper conduct and self-restraint during meals. It criticizes three behaviors:

1. ""À-jẹ-tán"" - Eating everything until nothing remains, showing greed
2. ""À-jẹ-ì-mọra"" - Eating without self-control or restraint
3. ""Ká fi ọwọ́ mẹ́wẹ̀ẹ̀wá jẹun"" - Using all ten fingers to eat (instead of the culturally appropriate way)

The proverb teaches that these behaviors lack dignity and refinement (""ò yẹ ọmọ èèyàn"" - not befitting of a human being). In Yoruba culture, showing moderation, self-control, and proper etiquette during meals reflects good upbringing and character.

The proverb serves as a reminder that how we eat reflects our inner character and upbringing, encouraging people to practice restraint and proper manners."
RAG,Anthropic,Òkùnkùn ò mẹni ọ̀wọ̀; ó dÍfá fún “Ìwọ́ tá nìyẹn”?,Darkness does not know who deserves deference; it consulted the oracle Ifá for “Who might you be?”,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:** ""Darkness doesn't recognize a person of honor; it casts Ifa divination for 'Who are you?'""

**Meaning:** This proverb conveys that darkness (night time) does not distinguish between people based on their social status or importance. In the dark, everyone is treated the same way, with the question ""Who are you?"" being asked of everyone regardless of their standing.

**Cultural context:** The proverb uses imagery from Ifa divination (a traditional Yoruba spiritual practice) to illustrate how darkness levels all social distinctions. The mention of ""Ìwọ́ tá nìyẹn"" (Who are you?) indicates that in darkness, even important people must identify themselves since they cannot be recognized by sight.

**Application:** This proverb is used to emphasize that certain circumstances (like darkness) are great equalizers that don't respect rank, wealth, or status. It can be used to remind people that in some situations, everyone faces the same challenges regardless of their position in society.

The other proverbs you provided express similar sentiments about equality in certain circumstances or questioning assumptions about who truly cares for you."
RAG,Anthropic,"Bí ayá bá mojú ọkọ, alárìnnà a yẹsẹ̀.","When the wife has got to know the husband, the marriage broker makes way.","# Translation and Explanation of ""Bí ayá bá mojú ọkọ, alárìnnà a yẹsẹ̀.""

## Translation
""When a wife knows her husband's face (understands him well), the mediator steps aside.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the nature of intimate relationships, particularly marriage. It means that when a wife truly understands her husband - his moods, preferences, character, and ways - there's no need for outside intervention or mediation in their affairs.

The proverb uses ""mojú"" (knows the face) metaphorically to represent deep understanding beyond just physical recognition. When spouses develop this level of understanding, third parties (""alárìnnà"" - the mediator or go-between) naturally become unnecessary and should withdraw (""yẹsẹ̀"" - step aside).

This wisdom highlights the importance of direct communication and understanding between couples, suggesting that intimate knowledge of one another eliminates the need for intermediaries and strengthens the marital bond."
RAG,Anthropic,Ẹni à ńgbé gẹ̀gẹ̀ ni yó ba ara-a rẹ̀ jẹ́.,It is the person who is revered that will disgrace himself or herself.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Ẹni à ńgbé gẹ̀gẹ̀ ni yó ba ara-a rẹ̀ jẹ́""

**Translation:** ""The person who is being carried like a child will end up harming themselves.""

**Explanation:** 
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the dangers of dependency and overreliance on others. When someone is constantly being carried (metaphorically) or overly assisted, they never develop their own capabilities or self-reliance. In the long run, this excessive dependence becomes harmful to the person themselves.

The proverb warns against creating situations where people become too dependent on help, as this ultimately prevents their personal growth and self-sufficiency. It encourages allowing people to develop their own skills and resilience by not doing everything for them.

This wisdom applies to many contexts - from parenting (where overprotection harms a child's development), to workplace mentoring, to community support systems, where the goal should be empowerment rather than creating dependency."
RAG,Anthropic,Tẹ̀tẹ̀ kì í tẹ́.,Spinach is never disgraced.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Tẹ̀tẹ̀ kì í tẹ́""

## Translation
""The buttocks don't get flattened"" or ""The bottom never becomes flat""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb uses a physical observation to convey a deeper wisdom about persistence and resilience. The buttocks, by their natural design, maintain their shape regardless of how long or how often one sits. They don't flatten permanently despite constant pressure.

The proverb metaphorically means that some things retain their essential nature despite external pressures. It speaks to natural resilience and the idea that certain fundamental characteristics cannot be permanently altered.

In practical application, this proverb might be used to:
- Suggest that people's true character or nature will eventually reveal itself
- Indicate that some problems or issues will persist despite attempts to suppress them
- Emphasize that some traditions or cultural practices endure despite modernization
- Remind people that certain realities cannot be changed no matter how much one tries

The proverb shares meaning with the others you listed which appear to deal with permanence, proper positioning, and respect for natural order."
RAG,Anthropic,Ẹní bá dẹ ojú-u rẹ̀ sílẹ̀ á rímú-u rẹ̀.,Whoever gazes downwards with will see his or her nose.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Ẹní bá dẹ ojú-u rẹ̀ sílẹ̀ á rímú-u rẹ̀""

**Literal Translation:**
""He who looks down will see his nose.""

**Meaning and Explanation:**
This Yoruba proverb conveys that if one looks down (either physically or metaphorically), they will inevitably see their nose. In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb teaches about self-awareness and the inevitability of confronting one's own reality.

The proverb functions on multiple levels:
- At a basic level, it states a physical truth - when you lower your eyes, you can indeed see your nose
- At a deeper level, it suggests that introspection leads to self-knowledge
- It implies that when you humble yourself and pay attention, you will discover things about yourself that were always there

The proverb encourages humility, self-examination, and acknowledgment of one's own traits or circumstances before looking outward to judge others."
RAG,Anthropic,"Onígẹ̀gẹ́ fìlẹ̀kẹ̀ dọ́pọ̀; onílẹ̀kẹ̀ ìbá gbowo, ko rọ́rùn fìlẹ̀kẹ̀ so.",The person with goitre offers a ridiculously low price for beads; were the beads seller to accept her offer she would have no neck to string the beads around.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Translation:**
""The owner of beads uses beads to make a bundle; if the owner of beads had money, it wouldn't be beads that they would tie together.""

**Explanation:**
This proverb speaks to the concept of making do with what you have, even when it's not ideal. The person who owns beads is using them to bundle things together because that's what they have available. However, if they had money (better resources), they wouldn't resort to using their valuable beads for such a mundane purpose.

The deeper meaning teaches about:
1. Making the best of limited resources
2. Using what you have at hand when necessary, even if it's not the optimal solution
3. The irony that sometimes people must use their valuables for practical purposes because they lack alternatives

This proverb reflects the Yoruba philosophy of resourcefulness and adaptation while acknowledging the constraints people face in challenging circumstances."
RAG,Anthropic,Bí a bá ti mọ là ńdé; a-láì-lẹ́ṣin kì í dé wọ̀nwọ̀n.,One arrives according to one's worth; a horseless person does not arrive with the noise of hoofs and stirrups.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:** ""One builds according to one's means; a person without a horse doesn't arrive with a swagger.""

**Meaning:** This proverb teaches about living within your means and being realistic about your capabilities. It conveys that people should act according to their resources and circumstances.

**Deeper explanation:**
The proverb uses two related images:
1. Building (or preparing) according to what you know or have
2. The contrast of someone without a horse trying to arrive with the grandiosity of someone who has one

In Yoruba culture, this proverb counsels humility and self-awareness. It suggests that pretending to have more status or ability than you actually possess is foolish. One should acknowledge their limitations rather than putting on airs. This doesn't mean one shouldn't aspire to improve, but rather that one should be honest about their current position.

The proverb encourages authenticity and discourages pretentiousness or living beyond one's means."
RAG,Anthropic,“Mo mọ̀wọ̀n ara-à mi” kì í ṣẹ̀rẹ̀kẹ́ èébú.,“I am jealous of my dignity” does not hurl insults at others.,"# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

## Translation
""'I know my limits' is not an excuse for insults.""

## Explanation
This proverb addresses the concept of self-awareness and responsibility for one's actions. It suggests that claiming to know your own limitations (""Mo mọ̀wọ̀n ara-à mi"") should not be used as a justification or shield when you have insulted someone. 

The proverb criticizes those who behave inappropriately or speak offensively to others and then try to excuse their behavior by claiming they know their own boundaries or limitations. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the importance of respectful communication and taking responsibility for one's words.

The essential wisdom here is that self-awareness should lead to better behavior, not serve as an excuse for poor behavior. True understanding of one's limits includes understanding the boundaries of acceptable social conduct."
RAG,Anthropic,A kì í bá ọba pàlà kí ọkọ́ ọba má ṣàn-ánni lẹ́sẹ̀.,One does not share a farm boundary with a king without getting one's feet gashed by the king's hoe.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""A kì í bá ọba pàlà kí ọkọ́ ọba má ṣàn-ánni lẹ́sẹ̀""

## Translation
""One cannot quarrel with the king and not expect the king's messengers to kick one's feet.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the consequences of challenging authority. When you oppose or argue with someone in power (the king), you should expect repercussions not just from them directly, but also from those who serve them (the king's messengers).

The proverb warns that challenging authority doesn't happen in isolation - those who are loyal to the authority figure will also retaliate against you. It highlights the interconnected nature of power structures and how confronting the leader often means dealing with their entire support system.

In contemporary contexts, this proverb might apply to situations like confronting a boss and then experiencing coldness from colleagues, or criticizing a community leader and finding yourself ostracized by community members.

The wisdom here is about understanding the full consequences of your actions when challenging established power."
RAG,Anthropic,"Bí eegbọ́n bá ṣo ayínrín nímú, adìẹ kọ́ ni yó ja.","If a tick clings to a fox's nose, it is not a chicken that will remove it.","# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb

**Literal translation:**
""If an elder puts mucus in his nose, it is not the chicken that will peck it off.""

**Meaning:**
This proverb speaks to the importance of respecting social hierarchy and appropriate roles. It suggests that when an elder or authority figure has a problem (symbolized by mucus in the nose), it's not the place of someone of lower status (represented by the chicken) to solve it or point it out.

The proverb teaches about proper social boundaries and respect. Just as a chicken shouldn't approach an elder's face to peck at mucus, junior members of society shouldn't overstep their boundaries when dealing with elders or authority figures, even when they notice something wrong.

The underlying wisdom is about knowing one's place in social interactions and understanding that certain issues should be addressed by peers or those of equal status, not by subordinates."
RAG,Anthropic,À-sẹ́-kú làgbàlagbà ńsẹ́ ọ̀ràn.,Denying-until-death is the way a venerable person denies a matter.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""À-sẹ́-kú làgbàlagbà ńsẹ́ ọ̀ràn""

## Translation
""It is to avoid death that an elder manages/handles matters carefully.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the wisdom that comes with age and experience. It suggests that elders handle situations cautiously and deliberately not out of fear or weakness, but from a desire for self-preservation and longevity.

The proverb reflects the Yoruba cultural value of respecting elders for their cautious approach to life. When an elder seems hesitant or overly careful in addressing an issue, it's not cowardice but wisdom born from experience. They understand the potential consequences of hasty actions and know that some battles are not worth fighting if they threaten one's wellbeing or life.

In Yoruba society, this proverb might be used to explain why elders often counsel patience, moderation, and careful consideration rather than impulsive action or confrontation."
RAG,Anthropic,"Ìṣẹ̀ ò ti ibìkan mú ẹni; ìyà ò tibìkan jẹ èèyàn; bí o bá rìnrìn òṣì, bí o bá ojú ìṣẹ́ wọ̀lú, igbá-kúgbá ni wọn ó fi bu omi fún ẹ mu.","Destitution does not attach to one at a particular place; suffering does not attack a person at a particular place; if one walks like a wretch into a town, if one looks like a loser when one enters a town, it is with a miserable calabash that the people will offer one water to drink.","# Translation and Explanation

**Translation:**
""Poverty doesn't come from a single place; suffering doesn't affect a person from just one source; if you walk around in poverty, if you enter a town with the face of poverty, they will use any available calabash to fetch water for you to drink.""

**Explanation:**
This Yoruba proverb speaks to how poverty and hardship manifest in one's life and affect how others treat you. The proverb conveys several layers of meaning:

1. **The multi-sourced nature of hardship**: The first part states that poverty and suffering don't come from just one place or cause - they can arise from various circumstances and situations.

2. **Visible poverty affects treatment**: When a person bears the visible marks of poverty (""the face of poverty""), they receive inferior treatment from others.

3. **The calabash metaphor**: Being served water with ""any available calabash"" (igbá-kúgbá) indicates disrespect - people won't bother to use proper or clean vessels for someone they perceive as poor. They'll use whatever is at hand, perhaps even a calabash normally considered unsuitable.

The proverb ultimately warns about how society tends to treat the visibly poor with disrespect and carelessness, highlighting the social consequences that accompany material poverty beyond the financial hardship itself."
RAG,Anthropic,"Oòrùn, kó tìẹ wọ̀ ká má bàá Ọlọ́jọ́ wí.","Sun, go set so one does not blame the owner of the day.","# Translation and Explanation of ""Oòrùn, kó tìẹ wọ̀ ká má bàá Ọlọ́jọ́ wí""

**Translation:** ""Let the sun set so that we don't have to blame the owner of the day.""

**Explanation:** 
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the idea of patience and waiting for the proper time for closure or judgment. It suggests that we should allow a situation to fully run its course (let the sun set completely) before making final assessments or criticisms.

The proverb uses the metaphor of the sun setting to represent the natural conclusion of events. ""Ọlọ́jọ́"" (owner of the day) represents a higher authority or divine power that controls time and circumstances.

The wisdom here is about:
1. Avoiding premature judgment
2. Respecting the natural order of things
3. Recognizing that time brings clarity and resolution

In practical terms, this proverb might be used to counsel someone to be patient rather than rushing to blame others or make decisions before a situation has fully developed."
RAG,Anthropic,"Mo dàgbà mo dàgó, aré ọmọdé ò tán lójúù mi.","I have become old and wise, but childish play has not ceased to appeal to me.","# Translation and Explanation of ""Mo dàgbà mo dàgó, aré ọmọdé ò tán lójúù mi""

## Translation
""I have grown old and tall, but the playfulness of youth has not left my eyes.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb speaks to the idea that despite physical aging, one can maintain a youthful spirit and outlook on life. It conveys that even though the person has grown old physically (""mo dàgbà"" - I have grown old) and tall/mature (""mo dàgó"" - I have grown tall/big), they still retain the enthusiasm, curiosity, and playfulness characteristic of youth (""aré ọmọdé ò tán lójúù mi"" - the play/energy of a child has not disappeared from my eyes).

The proverb celebrates the value of maintaining a youthful perspective regardless of age. It suggests that wisdom and maturity need not come at the expense of joy, wonder, and playfulness. It's similar to the English expression ""young at heart"" but more poetic in its imagery of youth remaining visible in one's eyes despite the body's aging."
RAG,Anthropic,Olóbìnrin kan kì í pagbo ìja.,A person who has only  one wife does not form a circle for a fight.,"# Translation and Explanation of ""Olóbìnrin kan kì í pagbo ìja""

## Translation
""A woman does not settle/conclude a fight.""

## Explanation
This Yoruba proverb suggests that in traditional Yoruba society, women were not typically expected to be the final arbiters in conflict resolution, particularly in public disputes or serious matters. It reflects the gender roles in traditional Yoruba culture where men were often considered the ultimate authority in resolving conflicts and making final judgments.

The proverb uses ""pagbo ìja"" (to settle or conclude a fight) as a metaphor for having the final say or decisive authority in conflict resolution. While women might participate in mediation processes, the final resolution was traditionally seen as the domain of male elders or leaders.

This proverb is one of many in Yoruba culture that reflects historical gender dynamics and role expectations, though modern interpretations and applications would certainly differ as social norms have evolved."
