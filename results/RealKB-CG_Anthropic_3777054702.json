  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u1eb8y\u1eb9 \u00f2 l\u00e8 r\u00ed omi in\u00fa \u00e0gb\u1ecdn b\u00f9 mu.\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u00c0gb\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u1eb9y\u1eb9 \u0144gb\u00e9; k\u00f2 l\u00e8 mu omi in\u00fa \u00e0gb\u1ecdn\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\n> Reflect on how this phrase informs the imagery or symbolism of the proverb.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00c0gb\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u1eb9y\u1eb9 \u0144gb\u00e9; k\u00f2 l\u00e8 mu omi in\u00fa \u00e0gb\u1ecdn\" translates to \"Birds perch fleetingly/temporarily; they cannot drink water from inside a coconut.\"\n2. This phrase establishes that birds have a limitation - they cannot access water that is inside a coconut.\n3. The imagery suggests a natural limitation based on physical capability or design.\n4. There's a contrast between the bird's freedom of movement (flying/perching) and its inability to access something contained within a closed space.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb uses the bird and coconut as symbols to express natural limitations. The bird represents a being with certain capabilities (flight) but also inherent limitations (inability to access enclosed water).\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.\n\nTranslation: \"A bird cannot see the water inside a coconut to drink it.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0p\u00e1r\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1 ni in\u00e1 \u0144d\u00e1; in\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u00e8 r\u00ed omi gb\u00e9\u1e63e.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The phrase \"\u00c0p\u00e1r\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1 ni in\u00e1 \u0144d\u00e1; in\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u00e8 r\u00ed omi gb\u00e9\u1e63e\" translates to \"Fire makes big flames; fire cannot see water to put itself out.\"\n2. This introduces another natural element (fire) that has both power (creating flames) and limitation (inability to extinguish itself).\n3. Both proverbs follow a similar structure: an entity with certain abilities cannot perceive or access something that lies outside its natural capacity.\n4. The concept of inherent limitations despite having other strengths is reinforced.\n\nInterim Insight: These proverbs establish a Yoruba philosophical concept about natural limitations - even powerful or capable entities have boundaries they cannot cross due to their inherent nature.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A bird cannot see the water inside a coconut to drink it.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the natural limitations that all beings have, regardless of their strengths in other areas. It teaches humility by highlighting that everyone has boundaries defined by their nature or position. The proverb can be applied to human contexts where people might overestimate their abilities or try to access knowledge or resources beyond their reach. It counsels self-awareness about one's limitations and the acceptance of natural boundaries. In Yoruba philosophy, understanding and accepting one's limitations is considered wisdom rather than weakness.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of natural limitations using the same imagery of birds and coconuts. Similar Phrase 2 extends this philosophical concept to other natural elements (fire), showing this is a broader principle in Yoruba thought about the natural order of capabilities and limitations.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8y\u1eb9 \u00f2 l\u00e8 r\u00ed omi in\u00fa \u00e0gb\u1ecdn b\u00f9 mu\" translates to \"A bird cannot see the water inside a coconut to drink it.\" It teaches that all beings have natural limitations regardless of their other capabilities. In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb encourages self-awareness about one's boundaries and cautions against attempting to reach beyond one's inherent capacity. It reminds us that recognizing and accepting our limitations is part of wisdom, not failure."
