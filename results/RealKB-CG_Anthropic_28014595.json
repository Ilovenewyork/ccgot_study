  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"B\u00ed ba\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300-\u1eb9\u0301 b\u00e1 \u0144t\u00e0k\u00ect\u00ec, \u00f2r\u00f3gi l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e1 \u1eb9m\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00c0\u00ec-l\u00e1p\u00e1 l\u00e0d\u00e1 \u00f2 m\u00fa; b\u00ed a b\u00e1 l\u00e1p\u00e1, \u1ecdm\u1ecd ow\u00fa to-o g\u00e9gi\" translates roughly to \"It's lack of strength that makes the machete ineffective; with enough strength, even cotton can cut wood.\"\n2. This suggests a theme about hierarchy, ability, and appropriate action based on one's position or capability.\n3. Both phrases seem to address how to handle situations with limited power or when dealing with authority figures.\n4. The similar phrase shows that perceived impossibility might be a matter of approach or strength rather than inherent inability.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely deals with hierarchical relationships and appropriate ways to address problems when authority figures are involved.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"If the household head is stomping/dancing wildly, it is with the rafters/roof beams that we deal with his companion/follower.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The second similar phrase \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 \u1e3fb\u00e1 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 j\u1eb9un l\u00f3ko, g\u00e0nm\u00f9ganmu im\u00fa \u1eb9ni n\u00ed \u0144w\u00f2\" translates approximately to \"When eating with a child in the farm, one watches the tip of one's own nose.\"\n2. This phrase emphasizes being mindful of one's own conduct when in a position of responsibility or authority.\n3. It suggests that interactions across hierarchical levels require careful attention to propriety and self-awareness.\n4. This reinforces the idea in our main proverb about indirect approaches to problems involving authority figures.\n\nInterim Insight: When dealing with authority figures who are behaving inappropriately, one should address the issue through indirect means or by focusing on those who enable or follow the authority figure.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"If the head of the household is stomping around wildly, we deal with his followers through the roof beams.\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb teaches wisdom in handling difficult situations involving authority figures. When a leader or person in power is behaving badly or irrationally, direct confrontation may be unwise. Instead, one should address the situation by dealing with their subordinates or the systems that support them. The proverb uses the metaphor of house architecture - rather than confronting the wild-acting household head directly, one works through structural elements (the rafters) to influence those who follow him. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of respecting hierarchical structures while still finding effective ways to resolve problems.\n\n- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the idea that perceived limitations can be overcome with proper approach and strategy. Similar Phrase 2 highlights the importance of self-awareness and indirect approaches when navigating relationships across different levels of authority.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"B\u00ed ba\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300-\u1eb9\u0301 b\u00e1 \u0144t\u00e0k\u00ect\u00ec, \u00f2r\u00f3gi l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e1 \u1eb9m\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300\" means \"If the head of the household is behaving wildly, we deal with his followers through the roof beams.\" It teaches that when confronted with irrational or difficult authority figures, the wise approach is not direct confrontation but rather addressing the issue through their supporters or the structures that uphold their authority. This reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on diplomatic problem-solving within hierarchical social structures."
