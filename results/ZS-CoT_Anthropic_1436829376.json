  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the elements:\n- \"Mo y\u00f3\" = \"I am full\"\n- \u0144j\u1eb9\u0301 = means/signifies\n- \"mo k\u1ecd\u0300\" = \"I refuse\" or \"I decline\"\n- j\u1eb9un \u01f9\u1e63\u00f3 = \"eating and being watchful\" or \"eating carefully/cautiously\"\n- \u00e0gb\u00e0 \u1ecd\u0300k\u00e1nj\u00faw\u00e0 = \"an elder with bad character\" or \"an elder with selfish tendencies\"\n- ni = is\n\nPutting it together, the proverb means:\n\n\"'I am full' means 'I am full,' 'I refuse' means 'I refuse'; eating while being watchful is the mark of an elder with bad character.\"\n\nThe deeper meaning: This proverb criticizes people who say one thing but mean another, particularly elders who should be straightforward. It suggests that someone who eats cautiously while claiming to be full or declining food is displaying poor character. The proverb values honesty and straightforwardness - if you're full, say so clearly; if you're declining, do so clearly. Being deceptive or calculating even in simple matters like eating shows poor character."
