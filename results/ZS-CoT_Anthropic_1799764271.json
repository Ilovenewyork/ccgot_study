  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\nFirst, I'll break down the components:\n- \"\u1eb8\u0300w\u1ecd\u0300n t\u00f3 t\u00f3 \u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9 \u00f2 t\u00f3-\u00f3 d\u00e1 erin d\u00far\u00f3\" - The first part seems to discuss a rope/chain that can hold a palm tree but cannot stop an elephant\n- \"\u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00ed erin m\u00e1 r\u00f2k\u00e8 \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n, t\u00f2un terin n\u00ed \u0144l\u1ecd\" - The second part talks about a vine that tries to prevent an elephant from climbing a savanna tree, but ends up going along with the elephant\n\nThe literal translation:\n\"A chain that is strong enough to hold a palm tree is not strong enough to stop an elephant; a vine that tells an elephant not to climb the savanna tree ends up going along with the elephant.\"\n\nThe meaning:\nThis proverb speaks about knowing your limits and the futility of trying to control something beyond your capacity. It suggests that what works in one situation may be completely inadequate in another that requires greater strength or authority. The second part emphasizes that attempting to restrain something much more powerful than yourself may result in you being carried along by that force instead.\n\nEnglish equivalent proverb: \"Know your limits\" or \"Don't bite off more than you can chew.\""
