When an elder washes their hands in preparation for a meal, they do so with the immediate intention to eat, not to delay or postpone.\n\nThe proverb teaches that:\n\n1. Preparedness should be followed by immediate action\n2. Experienced people (elders) understand that timing is critical \n3. One should not delay taking advantage of opportunities once ready\n\nIn Yoruba culture, elders are respected for their wisdom and practical knowledge. This proverb highlights how a wise person recognizes that preparation without follow-through diminishes the value of being prepared. It can be applied to many situations where someone prepares for something but then unnecessarily delays taking action."
