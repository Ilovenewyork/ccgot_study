  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:** \"While one tears the cloth from behind, another tears it from the front.\"\n\n**Meaning:** This proverb describes a situation where people are working at cross-purposes or undermining each other's efforts, often unknowingly. It illustrates how uncoordinated actions, even when intended to help, can lead to greater damage or problems.\n\n**Cultural context:** In traditional Yoruba society, cloth (\u00ecb\u00e0nt\u1eb9\u0301) is valuable and represents status and wealth. The image of people tearing it from different directions vividly illustrates wasteful or counterproductive behavior.\n\n**Application:** This proverb is used to advise on the importance of coordination, communication, and working together toward common goals. It warns against situations where lack of coordination between people or groups leads to wasted efforts or even making situations worse.\n\n**Similar English expressions:** \"The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing\" or \"Working at cross-purposes.\""
