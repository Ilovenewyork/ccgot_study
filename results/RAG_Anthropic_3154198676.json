While the general public might benefit from lower prices for indigo dye (a valuable commodity in traditional Yoruba society), the dye maker (at\u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e9) whose livelihood depends on selling it would be harmed by such price reductions.\n\nThe proverb illustrates how people's opinions and desires are often shaped by their personal interests. What seems beneficial from one perspective may be detrimental from another. It warns against making judgments about situations without considering how they affect all parties involved, especially those with a direct stake in the matter.\n\nIn broader application, this wisdom cautions against advocating for changes that don't affect you personally while ignoring the impact on those directly involved in the profession or situation."
