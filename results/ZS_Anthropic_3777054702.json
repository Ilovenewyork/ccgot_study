  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8y\u1eb9 \u00f2 l\u00e8 r\u00ed omi in\u00fa \u00e0gb\u1ecdn b\u00f9 mu\" translates to English as:\n\n\"A bird cannot drink water from inside a coconut.\"\n\nThe proverb is speaking about limitations or inaccessibility. It suggests that some things remain out of reach for certain individuals despite their desire or efforts, similar to how a bird cannot access the water inside a coconut due to the hard shell barrier."
