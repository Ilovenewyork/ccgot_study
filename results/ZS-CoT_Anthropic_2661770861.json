  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, I'll break down the key terms in the proverb:\n- \"On\u00edg\u1eb9\u0300g\u1eb9\u0301\" - the owner of g\u1eb9\u0300g\u1eb9\u0301 (a type of bead)\n- \"f\u00ecl\u1eb9\u0300k\u1eb9\u0300 d\u1ecd\u0301p\u1ecd\u0300\" - threads/strings beads together\n- \"on\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300k\u1eb9\u0300\" - the owner of beads/the person who wears beads\n- \"\u00ecb\u00e1 gbowo\" - would get/receive money\n- \"ko r\u1ecd\u0301r\u00f9n f\u00ecl\u1eb9\u0300k\u1eb9\u0300 so\" - it is not easy to string beads\n\nPutting it together, the proverb can be translated as:\n\n\"The bead maker strings beads together; if the wearer of beads had money, they would realize it's not easy to string beads.\"\n\nThe meaning conveys that people often don't appreciate the difficulty of skilled work until they try to do it themselves. It suggests that we should value craftspeople and their expertise, as what looks simple to consumers often requires significant skill and effort to produce."
