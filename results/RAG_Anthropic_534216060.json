It points out the contradiction of someone who has never experienced wealth or honor (oj\u00fa \u00f2 r\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e1 r\u00ed) yet names their child \"\u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" (meaning \"wealth/honor is sweet\"). \n\n**Deeper Explanation**: The proverb criticizes people who praise or glorify things they have never personally experienced. It highlights the irony of speaking authoritatively about something one doesn't truly know. In Yoruba culture, naming is significant and often reflects aspirations or circumstances, so naming a child \"Wealth is sweet\" when you've never had wealth shows either hopeful aspiration or pretension.\n\nThis proverb serves as a caution against pretending to have knowledge about experiences one hasn't actually had, or speaking with authority about unfamiliar situations."
