The similar phrase \"\u1eb8\u0300r\u00fak\u1ecd\u0301 \u0144\u1e63e b\u00ed \u1ecdk\u1ecd\u0301\" translates to \"The canoe behaves/appears like a ship\" or \"A small boat pretends to be a big vessel.\"\n2. This phrase uses the structure \"X \u0144\u1e63e b\u00ed Y\" (X behaves/pretends to be Y), where X is something smaller or less significant trying to imitate Y, which is greater or more significant.\n3. This suggests our proverb follows a similar pattern of comparing things that may look alike but have different values or significance.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely deals with false appearances or imitation, where something of lesser value is mimicking or being compared to something of greater value.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"\u1e62\u00e0k\u00ec (a type of cloth) behaves like \u1ecd\u0300r\u00e1 (velvet), egungun (bones/masquerade) behaves like \u1eb9ran (meat/flesh).\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The phrase \"\u00ccj\u00e0k\u00f9m\u1ecd\u0300 k\u00ec \u00ed rin \u1ecd\u0300s\u00e1n, \u1eb9ni a b\u00ed ire k\u00ec \u00ed rin \u00f2ru\" translates to \"The wildcat doesn't walk during the day, a person born for good fortune doesn't walk at night.\"\n2. This proverb establishes natural order and proper behavior - things have their proper time, place, and nature.\n3. It suggests that things should act according to their true nature, not pretend to be what they are not.\n4. This adds a moral dimension to our main proverb - pretending to be something you're not goes against natural order.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely warns against pretense and emphasizes the importance of authenticity and accepting one's true nature.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"\u1e62\u00e0k\u00ec (cloth) pretends to be velvet, bones pretend to be meat.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against false appearances and pretense. Just as common cloth cannot truly be luxurious velvet, and dry bones cannot be succulent meat, people should not pretend to be what they are not. In Yoruba culture, authenticity is highly valued, and this proverb cautions against deception and false pretenses. It reminds people to recognize the true nature of things and not be fooled by outward appearances. The proverb could be applied to situations where someone or something is pretending to have qualities or value they do not actually possess.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 supports the structure of comparison between imitation and authentic items, while Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the cultural value of natural order and authentic behavior.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u1e62\u00e0k\u00ec \u0144\u1e63e b\u00ed \u1ecd\u0300r\u00e1, egungun \u0144\u1e63e b\u00ed \u1eb9ran\" translates to \"Common cloth pretends to be velvet, bones pretend to be meat.\" It warns against deception and false appearances, emphasizing the Yoruba cultural value of authenticity. It teaches that no matter how much something tries to imitate something else of higher value, its true nature cannot be changed, and discerning people will recognize the difference."
