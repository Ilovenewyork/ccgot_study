  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"Al\u00e1ti\u1e63e n\u00ed m\u0301m\u1ecd \u00e0ti\u1e63e ara-a r\u00e8\u0323\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Al\u00e1ti\u1e63e**: This word can be broken into \"al\u00e1\" (owner or possessor) and \"ti\u1e63e\" (of doing or action). Together, \"al\u00e1ti\u1e63e\" refers to someone who is responsible for or in charge of doing something.\n\n2. **N\u00ed m\u0301m\u1ecd**: \"N\u00ed\" means \"is\" or \"has,\" and \"m\u0301m\u1ecd\" means \"knows\" or \"understands.\" So, \"n\u00ed m\u0301m\u1ecd\" translates to \"knows\" or \"understands.\"\n\n3. **\u00c0ti\u1e63e ara-a r\u00e8\u0323**: \"\u00c0ti\u1e63e\" means \"the act of doing\" or \"work,\" \"ara-a\" means \"his/her own,\" and \"r\u00e8\u0323\" is a possessive pronoun meaning \"his/her.\" So, \"\u00e0ti\u1e63e ara-a r\u00e8\u0323\" translates to \"his/her own work\" or \"his/her own actions.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb \"Al\u00e1ti\u1e63e n\u00ed m\u0301m\u1ecd \u00e0ti\u1e63e ara-a r\u00e8\u0323\" can be translated into English as:\n\n\"The one responsible for the work knows how to do it themselves.\"\n\nThis proverb emphasizes the idea that a person who is in charge of a task or responsibility is the one who truly understands how to carry it out."
