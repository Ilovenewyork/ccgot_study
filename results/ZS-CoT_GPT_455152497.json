It suggests that failing to address or remove certain issues or problems can lead to negative consequences. Each item mentioned (\u1eb9mo\u0301\u0323n, \u00e0f\u00e8, m\u00e1l\u00e1\u00e0j\u00fa) symbolizes different aspects or problems that need attention.\n\n4. **Final Translation**: The proverb can be translated as:\n   \"Failure to remove [the problem] kills the \u1eb9mo\u0301\u0323n; failure to remove [the problem] kills the \u00e0f\u00e8; failure to remove [the problem] kills the m\u00e1l\u00e1\u00e0j\u00fa.\"\n\nIn essence, the proverb emphasizes the importance of addressing issues before they lead to detrimental outcomes."
