  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb \"Mo d\u00e0gb\u00e0 mo d\u00e0g\u00f3, ar\u00e9 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 \u00f2 t\u00e1n l\u00f3j\u00fa\u00f9 mi\" translates to English as:\n\n\"I have grown old and gray, but I still appreciate the playfulness of children.\"\n\nThe proverb essentially means that despite aging, one still values and understands youthful energy and playfulness. It suggests that wisdom includes maintaining connection with the joy and innocence of childhood even as one advances in age."
