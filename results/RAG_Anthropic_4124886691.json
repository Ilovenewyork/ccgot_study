  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:**\n\"The Ijesha mud/clay splashes on someone's body, it's not expensive.\"\n\n**Meaning and explanation:**\nThis proverb refers to the idea that when mud from Ijesha land splashes on someone, it doesn't cost anything or cause serious harm. The deeper meaning relates to situations where someone causes minor offense or inconvenience to another person but doesn't consider it significant or worth apologizing for.\n\nThe proverb serves as a critique of inconsiderate behavior - it points out how people might dismiss the discomfort they cause others simply because it doesn't affect them personally or because they don't value the other person's feelings.\n\nIt teaches about empathy and consideration - what seems insignificant to the person causing harm (the mud splasher) might be quite bothersome to the recipient (the person getting splashed).\n\nThis proverb is used to remind people to be mindful of how their actions affect others, even in seemingly small ways."
