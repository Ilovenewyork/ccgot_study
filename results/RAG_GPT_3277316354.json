  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00cct\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 t\u00f3 o\u0300\u0323p\u1eb9 k\u00f2 t\u00f3 p\u00e9 k\u00e9rin m\u00e1 l\u1ecd; \u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 p\u00e9 k\u00e9rin m\u00e1 l\u1ecd \u00c0lo\u0301\u0323, t\u00f2un terin n\u00ed \u0144l\u1ecd\" can be translated to English as: \"A rope tied to a palm tree is not strong enough to stop an elephant from moving; a rope that claims to stop an elephant from moving is only fooling itself, as the elephant will continue on its path.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb uses the imagery of a rope and an elephant to convey a message about the futility of trying to restrain or control something that is beyond one's capacity. The palm tree and the rope symbolize efforts or measures that are inadequate for the task at hand. The elephant represents a powerful force or situation that cannot be easily stopped or controlled. The proverb suggests that one should recognize the limits of their abilities and not overestimate their capacity to control or influence situations that are inherently beyond their control. It is a reminder to be realistic about one's capabilities and to avoid self-deception."
