  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"E\u0323y\u1eb9 t\u00f3 fi ara w\u00e9 ig\u00fan, \u00e8\u0323h\u00ecn \u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144s\u00f9n\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **E\u0323y\u1eb9** - This means \"bird\" in English.\n2. **t\u00f3 fi ara w\u00e9 ig\u00fan** - This phrase means \"that imitates a vulture.\" Here, \"fi ara w\u00e9\" means \"to imitate\" or \"to compare oneself to,\" and \"ig\u00fan\" means \"vulture.\"\n3. **\u00e8\u0323h\u00ecn \u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2** - This translates to \"behind the kitchen\" or \"back of the stove.\" \"\u00c8\u0323h\u00ecn\" means \"behind\" or \"back,\" and \"\u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2\" refers to a traditional kitchen or stove.\n4. **n\u00ed \u0144s\u00f9n** - This means \"sleeps\" or \"rests.\" \"N\u00ed\" is a particle indicating present tense, and \"\u0144s\u00f9n\" means \"sleeps.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as:\n\"The bird that imitates a vulture sleeps behind the kitchen.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that someone who tries to imitate or pretend to be something they are not may end up in an undesirable or lesser position. It highlights the idea of authenticity and the consequences of pretending to be something one is not."
