  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"A-bin\u00fa-f\u00f9f\u00f9 n\u00ed \u0144w\u00e1 o\u00fanj\u1eb9 f\u00fan a-bin\u00fa-w\u00e9\u0323r\u00e9\u0323-w\u00e9\u0323r\u00e9\u0323\" can be translated to English as \"The one who is deeply angry seeks food for the one who is slightly angry.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb highlights the idea that someone who is experiencing intense emotions or anger often ends up taking actions or making decisions that benefit those who are less affected or less involved. It suggests that the person with the greater intensity of emotion (a-bin\u00fa-f\u00f9f\u00f9) may inadvertently provide for or support someone who is only mildly affected (a-bin\u00fa-w\u00e9\u0323r\u00e9\u0323-w\u00e9\u0323r\u00e9\u0323). It can be interpreted as a commentary on how strong emotions can lead to unintended consequences, often benefiting others who are not as deeply involved in the situation."
