  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 t\u00ed \u00f2 k\u00ed \u00c0\u00e0r\u1eb9 \u0144fi ok\u00f9n sin ara-a r\u00e8\u0323\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0**: This word means \"elder\" or \"an elderly person.\"\n\n2. **t\u00ed \u00f2 k\u00ed \u00c0\u00e0r\u1eb9**: \"t\u00ed \u00f2\" means \"who does not,\" \"k\u00ed\" means \"greet,\" and \"\u00c0\u00e0r\u1eb9\" refers to \"the chief\" or \"a leader.\" So, this part translates to \"who does not greet the chief.\"\n\n3. **\u0144fi ok\u00f9n sin ara-a r\u00e8\u0323**: \"\u0144fi\" means \"uses,\" \"ok\u00f9n\" means \"rope,\" \"sin\" means \"to tie\" or \"to bind,\" and \"ara-a r\u00e8\u0323\" means \"himself\" or \"his own body.\" This part translates to \"uses a rope to bind himself.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated into English as: \"An elder who does not greet the chief uses a rope to bind himself.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that an elder who fails to show respect or acknowledge authority (by not greeting the chief) is essentially causing harm or creating problems for themselves. It emphasizes the importance of respect and proper conduct within a community."
