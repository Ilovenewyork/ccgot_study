  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"B\u00ed k\u00f2 s\u00ed t\u1ecd\u0300b\u00f9n \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n, ta ni \u00ecb\u00e1 j\u00ed l\u00f3w\u00f9\u00far\u1ecd\u0300 t\u00ed k\u00f2 b\u1ecd\u0301j\u00fa \u1e63\u00e1\u1e63\u00e1?\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 ti m\u1ecd l\u00e0 \u0144k\u00fa; olongo k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00fa t\u00ecy\u00e0nt\u00ecy\u00e0n\" translates to \"One dies the way one is known (or according to one's character); a respected person doesn't die disgracefully.\"\n2. This establishes a theme of personal character and how it relates to one's life path and dignity.\n3. Both proverbs start with \"B\u00ed\" (if), suggesting conditional reasoning in Yoruba philosophical thinking.\n4. The similar phrase emphasizes how one's reputation and character determine one's legacy, suggesting a link to personal habits and consistency.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely addresses the relationship between personal character/habits and natural consequences, possibly focusing on morning routines as symbolic of one's character.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"If it were not part of a person's nature/habit, who would wake up in the morning and not wash their face?\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"B\u00ed oj\u00fa k\u00f2 b\u00e1 ti ol\u00e8, a ti ar\u00e1 il\u00e9 \u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"If a thief is not ashamed, his family members will be.\"\n2. This introduces concepts of shame, responsibility, and how individual actions reflect on one's community.\n3. Both proverbs deal with expected behavior and deviations from norms.\n4. The second similar phrase suggests that when natural expectations aren't met, there are social consequences.\n\nInterim Insight: The main proverb uses face-washing (a universal morning routine) to illustrate how certain behaviors are so natural and expected that only an unusual person would neglect them, suggesting that fundamental habits reveal character.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"If it were not part of a person's nature (or bad habit), who would wake up in the morning and not wash their face?\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb uses the universal act of washing one's face in the morning as a metaphor for basic decency and normal human behavior. It suggests that when someone consistently fails to do what is obviously expected or beneficial, it reveals something fundamental about their character rather than being a simple oversight. In Yoruba culture, personal hygiene is linked to moral cleanliness, and this proverb teaches that habitual neglect of basic responsibilities reflects a character flaw rather than a mere mistake. The proverb can be applied to situations where someone repeatedly fails to meet basic expectations, suggesting their behavior stems from their inherent nature rather than circumstances.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 connects the proverb to how character determines one's path in life, while Similar Phrase 2 enriches the interpretation by highlighting how deviations from expected behavior have social consequences."
