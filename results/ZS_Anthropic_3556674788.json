  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"Rather than prostrate (bow down) to a Hausa man (Gambari), it's better to be brave and die.\"\n\nThe proverb expresses an extreme preference for maintaining one's dignity and pride rather than submitting to someone considered an outsider or traditional rival. It reflects historical ethnic tensions between the Yoruba and Hausa peoples in Nigeria. The term \"Gambari\" is a Yoruba reference to Hausa people."
