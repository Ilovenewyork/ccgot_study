  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"A bird that compares itself to a vulture ends up sleeping behind a trash heap.\"\n\nThis proverb warns against trying to imitate or compete with someone who is in a completely different position or has different capabilities than you. It suggests that when you try to be something you're not or overestimate your abilities by comparing yourself to those who are naturally equipped for certain roles, you may end up in an undignified or unfortunate situation."
