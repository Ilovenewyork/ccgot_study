This proverb speaks to understanding one's place and limitations in a given context.\n3. It suggests that even naturally vocal creatures (dogs) know when to be quiet (in a predator's domain).\n4. This relates to our main proverb through the theme of natural limitations and appropriate behavior according to one's station.\n5. Both proverbs appear to address the concept of knowing one's boundaries and acting accordingly.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our main proverb likely deals with understanding limitations and proper conduct based on one's position or capabilities.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The size of the mouse determines the size of the trap/mat; the lizard does not take up excessive space.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\n> Similar Phrase 2: B\u00ed a b\u00e1 ti m\u1ecd l\u00e0 \u0144k\u00fa; olongo k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00fa t\u00ecy\u00e0nt\u00ecy\u00e0n.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 ti m\u1ecd l\u00e0 \u0144k\u00fa; olongo k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00fa t\u00ecy\u00e0nt\u00ecy\u00e0n\" translates to \"One dies according to one's status; a lizard does not die in an exaggerated manner.\"\n2. This proverb emphasizes that one should live and die according to their social standing or means.\n3. The reference to \"olongo\" (lizard) appears in both proverbs, suggesting it's a cultural symbol for knowing one's place.\n4. The repetition of the lizard motif confirms that the main proverb relates to modesty, propriety, and living within one's means.\n5. Both phrases emphasize the importance of not overreaching or being pretentious.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase reinforces that our main proverb addresses the virtue of modesty and accepting one's natural station in life without pretense or excess.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The size of the mouse determines the size of the trap; a lizard does not take up excessive space.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches the importance of living within one's means and accepting one's natural position in society. It uses the metaphor of a mouse trap being proportional to the mouse it's meant to catch, suggesting that provisions and accommodations should be appropriate to the need. The second part about the lizard reinforces that one should not be pretentious or take up more space (literal or figurative) than befits their station. In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to counsel against extravagance, pretentiousness, or overreaching one's social position. It emphasizes the virtues of modesty, contentment, and social appropriateness.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 (\"A dog does not bark in the den of a leopard\") and Similar Phrase 2 (\"One dies according to one's status; a lizard does not die in an exaggerated manner\") both reinforce the cultural value of knowing one's place and behaving accordingly.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0300n eku n\u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300n \u00ect\u1eb9\u0301; olongo k\u00ec \u00ed gb\u00e9 t\u00ecm\u00f9t\u00ecm\u00f9\" translates to \"The size of the mouse determines the size of the trap; a lizard does not take up excessive space.\" It teaches the importance of living within one's means and not pretending to be more than you are. This reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on appropriate behavior according to one's social position, advocating for modesty and authenticity rather than pretentiousness or excess."

This phrase implies consequences for those who overstep their boundaries or position within a social hierarchy.\n3. It suggests that pretending to have authority or status that you don't legitimately possess will inevitably lead to natural consequences.\n4. This connects to our proverb as both involve social positioning and pretending to be what one is not.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely addresses consequences of falsely claiming a status or position one doesn't have within a social hierarchy.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind the chicken coop.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0f\u00f2pin\u00e1 t\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 pa f\u00ect\u00edl\u00e0, ara \u1eb9\u0300 ni y\u00f3 pa\" translates to \"The wind that claims it will extinguish the lamp will only destroy itself.\"\n2. This phrase warns against overestimating one's abilities or challenging forces beyond one's capacity.\n3. It suggests that attempting to perform tasks beyond one's natural abilities can lead to self-destruction or failure.\n4. This connects to our proverb about the bird comparing itself to a vulture - both involve pretension and its consequences.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces that our proverb is about the dangers of pretension and attempting to assume a status or role beyond one's natural capacity.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind the chicken coop.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against pretension and attempting to claim a status or position beyond one's true capacity. In Yoruba culture, the vulture (ig\u00fan) is a large, powerful bird with a certain status, while sleeping behind a chicken coop represents a lowly, undignified position. The proverb teaches that those who falsely elevate themselves or pretend to be more important than they are will ultimately find themselves in embarrassing or undignified circumstances. It emphasizes the importance of authenticity and accepting one's true position in life rather than pretending to be something one is not.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 warns about consequences of overstepping social boundaries, while Similar Phrase 2 cautions against challenging forces beyond one's capacity.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8y\u1eb9 t\u00f3 fi ara w\u00e9 ig\u00fan, \u1eb9\u0300h\u00ecn \u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144s\u00f9n\" translates to \"A bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind the chicken coop.\" It teaches that those who pretend to be more important than they truly are will ultimately end up in undignified circumstances. In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb encourages authenticity and self-awareness rather than false pretension or imitation of those with higher status. It reminds us that pretending to be something we are not often leads to embarrassment or failure."

A hawk cannot easily eat a snail because of the snail's protective shell, so this represents an idle or meaningless boast.\n3. This suggests our target proverb may also deal with unrealistic claims or someone overestimating their abilities.\n4. Both proverbs appear to use animal or natural imagery to convey lessons about human behavior and limitations.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely addresses someone making unrealistic claims or promises they cannot fulfill, possibly using metaphorical language about animals or natural elements.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The grasshopper claims it can clear the path; who will follow the path of a grasshopper?\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eb8n\u00eckan k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\u0301 \"\u00c0w\u00e1 d\u00e9.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eb8n\u00eckan k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\u0301 '\u00c0w\u00e1 d\u00e9'\" translates to \"One person cannot be 'We have arrived'\" or \"A single person cannot claim to be a group.\"\n2. This proverb emphasizes that one person cannot represent or speak for many, highlighting limitations of individual claims or representation.\n3. This adds context to our main proverb by suggesting it's not just about boastfulness but about the limits of individual capability versus collective action.\n4. The grasshopper proverb and this phrase both question inappropriate claims of capability or representation.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase confirms our proverb addresses the mismatch between claimed abilities and actual capabilities, specifically questioning individual claims to accomplish tasks that might require collective effort.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The grasshopper claims it can clear the path; who would follow the path cleared by a grasshopper?\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes those who make grand claims beyond their actual capabilities. A grasshopper is too small to effectively clear a path that would be useful to others, just as some people boast about abilities they don't possess. The proverb questions not just the boast itself but also suggests that even if such claims were true, they would be of little value to others. It teaches humility and warns against following those who make unrealistic promises. In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to caution against following unreliable leaders or believing in empty promises.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase about the hawk and snail reinforces the theme of impossible boasts, while the second phrase about one person not being \"we\" emphasizes the limitations of individual claims versus collective responsibility.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0w\u00far\u00e8be\u00e9 n\u00ed \u00f2\u00fan l\u00e8 y\u1eb9\u0300n\u00e0; ta n\u00ed j\u1eb9\u0301 t\u1ecd \u1ecd\u0300n\u00e0 \u00e0w\u00far\u00e8be?\" translates to \"The grasshopper claims it can clear the path; who would follow the path cleared by a grasshopper?\" It warns against both making claims beyond one's capabilities and trusting those who make such unrealistic boasts. In Yoruba wisdom, this teaches discernment in choosing who to follow and cautions against self-aggrandizement."

This similar phrase contains scenarios where different entities \"t\u1eb9\u0301 l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301\" (land in the hands of) different people or things: the yam lands with the yam owner, the lizard lands on the wall, and the turtle lands in \"my\" hands.\n2. The repetition of \"t\u1eb9\u0301 l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301\" (landing in someone's hands) suggests a pattern of things naturally returning to where they belong or finding their rightful place.\n3. The phrase illustrates natural consequences and inherent relationships between entities.\n\nInterim Insight: The word \"t\u1eb9\u0301\" in this context relates to landing, settling, or ending up in someone's hands or possession. The similar phrase suggests that things ultimately find their natural or appropriate place.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Don't land in the hands of the homeowner, don't land in the hands of the visitor; one should land in one's own hands.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \"Ab\u00f9l\u00e0\u01f9g\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63as\u00e1n; b\u00edy\u00e0\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u1ecd\u0301r\u1ecd\u0300, baba a l\u00f3w\u00f3 l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase suggests that a person of mixed heritage is never without resources - if the mother doesn't have wealth/words, the father will have money in hand.\n2. It emphasizes self-reliance through family connections and acknowledges multiple sources of support.\n3. The phrase \"l\u00f3w\u00f3 l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301\" (having money in hand) relates to our proverb's focus on \"l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301\" (in the hands), reinforcing the importance of personal possession and self-sufficiency.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase emphasizes self-reliance and personal resources, suggesting that one should depend on oneself rather than on others, which aligns with our main proverb's message of self-dependence.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Don't depend on the homeowner, don't depend on the visitor; depend on yourself.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the value of self-reliance and personal responsibility in Yoruba culture. It advises against depending on others, whether they are hosts (homeowners) or guests (visitors), suggesting that true security comes from depending on oneself. The proverb reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on independence, self-sufficiency, and taking responsibility for one's own affairs. In a community-oriented culture, this proverb interestingly highlights the importance of individual agency while acknowledging the social context of homeowners and visitors.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase reinforces how things naturally belong in certain places, suggesting we too should rely on our natural resources. The second phrase supports the theme of self-reliance by showing how one should leverage their own connections and resources rather than depending on others."

This phrase uses natural imagery (vulture, house, farm) to express a principle about how things that are obvious or powerful cannot be ignored.\n3. The vulture perching on the roof is highly visible and significant - suggesting prominence and unavoidable presence.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests the main proverb may deal with hierarchies of power or visibility, where certain forces or entities dominate others in ways that cannot be avoided or denied.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One masquerade surpasses another masquerade; one deity surpasses another deity; The red cloth (or leopard) forces the Shango devotee into the bush.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The phrase \"E\u00e9g\u00fan \u00f2 na ob\u00ecnrin l\u00e1g\u1ecd\u0300; ob\u00ecnr\u00edn t\u00fa k\u00edj\u00ecp\u00e1 \u00ecd\u00ed-i r\u1eb9\u0300, \u00f3 fi na e\u00e9g\u00fan\" translates to \"The masquerade does not whip a woman in the gathering; the woman untied her wrapper and used it to whip the masquerade.\" \n2. This phrase illustrates that even powerful cultural entities like the e\u00e9g\u00fan (masquerade) have limitations and can be challenged by those presumed weaker (women).\n3. It suggests a subversion of expected power dynamics in Yoruba culture - even sacred figures have vulnerabilities.\n\nInterim Insight: This contextualizes our main proverb by suggesting that hierarchies of power (even spiritual ones) are not absolute. There are circumstances where even the most powerful entities must yield to others or face consequences.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One masquerade surpasses another masquerade; one deity surpasses another deity; The red cloth forces the Shango devotee into the bush.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the relativity of power and authority, even among spiritual beings. In Yoruba cosmology, both e\u00e9g\u00fan (ancestral masquerades) and \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 (deities) exist in hierarchies where some are more powerful than others. The third part refers to how even a Shango devotee (a powerful deity of thunder) can be forced to retreat when confronted with certain symbols or powers (the p\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1 or red cloth, which may represent a competing spiritual force or taboo). \n\n  The proverb teaches humility by reminding us that no matter how powerful someone or something is, there is always something more powerful. Even spiritual authorities have their limitations and must sometimes yield to greater forces. This reflects the Yoruba understanding of a complex, interconnected universe where power is relative rather than absolute.\n\n- References: The vulture imagery in Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the visibility of power hierarchies, while Similar Phrase 2 demonstrates how even sacred institutions have boundaries and can be challenged under certain circumstances.\n\nFinal Answer: This Yoruba proverb illustrates the relativity of power in both spiritual and worldly realms. It reveals that hierarchies exist everywhere\u2014even among masquerades and deities\u2014and reminds us that no one is supreme in all situations. The imagery of a Shango devotee being forced into the bush by a red cloth (p\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1) demonstrates how even powerful figures have their vulnerabilities and must sometimes retreat. The proverb ultimately teaches humility and respect for the complex power dynamics that govern both the spiritual and physical worlds in Yoruba cosmology."

This relates to our main proverb which appears to address behaviors around food and satisfaction, possibly highlighting individualistic versus communal attitudes.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"I am full\" means \"I am full,\" \"I refuse\" means \"I refuse\"; eating alone, (this is) an elder with selfish character.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Mo m\u1ecc\u0300b\u00e0r\u00e0 mo m\u1ecc\u0300f\u00fan\" ti k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00ed \u00e0w\u00f2ko k\u1ecd\u0301 \u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9\u0301\u1eb9\u0300r\u1eb9\u0301 n\u00cdf\u00e1\" roughly translates to \"Saying 'I know this, I know that' prevents the parrot from learning Ifa divination.\"\n2. This proverb warns against pride and over-confidence that prevents learning and growth.\n3. It emphasizes the value of humility and openness to continued learning in Yoruba wisdom traditions.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase highlights how self-satisfaction and pride can prevent growth and proper social conduct. This connects to our main proverb by reinforcing that selfish behavior (like eating alone) reflects poorly on one's character, especially for someone who should know better (an elder).\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n\n- Final Translation: \"When I say 'I am satisfied,' it means I am truly satisfied; when I say 'I decline,' it means I truly decline; one who eats alone is an elder with a selfish character.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes selfish behavior, particularly around food sharing which is sacred in African cultures. It specifically condemns elders who eat alone, as they should be exemplars of community values. In Yoruba society, sharing food is a fundamental expression of community, and refusing to share (especially by respected elders) represents a serious moral failing. The proverb teaches that true wisdom includes generosity and community-mindedness, not just age or status. It warns against self-centered attitudes that place individual satisfaction above communal welfare.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase (\"Who knows Okolo in Oyo?\") reminds us of the importance of social recognition and proper conduct within the community. The second phrase about the parrot unable to learn Ifa reinforces how pride and self-satisfaction prevent proper growth and social development, much like the selfish elder who eats alone has failed to develop proper character despite their age.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb criticizes selfishness, particularly in elders who should know better. In Yoruba culture, eating alone is considered deeply selfish, as sharing food is a fundamental social obligation. The proverb uses the contrast between personal satisfaction (\"I am full\") and social responsibility to teach that true wisdom includes generosity, not just age. It serves as a warning against putting individual desires above community welfare."

This phrase speaks to self-deception and overestimating one's importance in a communal setting.\n3. Both phrases involve forms of self-deception or inappropriate self-assessment.\n4. The similar phrase suggests a theme of maintaining proper humility and realistic self-assessment within Yoruba cultural values.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely deals with inappropriate behavior or claims by elders who should know better, particularly relating to self-deception or false claims about their capabilities.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"An elder doesn't finish washing hands and then say he will eat with them dirty.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00e0 l\u1ecd\u0301j\u00e0 k\u00f3r\u00ed \u1ecdm\u1ecd titun w\u1ecd\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00e0 l\u1ecd\u0301j\u00e0 k\u00f3r\u00ed \u1ecdm\u1ecd titun w\u1ecd\u0301\" translates to \"An elder cannot be present in the marketplace and allow a child's head to be improperly wrapped.\"\n2. This phrase emphasizes the responsibility of elders to guide, correct, and maintain proper order in society.\n3. It reinforces the cultural expectation that elders should model proper behavior and wisdom.\n4. Both proverbs start with \"\u00c0gb\u00e0\" (elder), indicating they speak to the expected standards for elders in Yoruba society.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb emphasizes the inconsistency of an elder who maintains cleanliness (washing hands) but then contradicts this proper behavior with an improper claim or action (saying they'll eat with dirty hands anyway).\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"An elder doesn't finish washing their hands and then claim they will eat with dirty hands.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the importance of consistency in character and actions, especially for elders who should exemplify wisdom. It criticizes hypocrisy and self-contradiction, particularly when someone does something right (washing hands) but then undermines it with contradictory words or actions. In Yoruba culture, elders are expected to be role models and demonstrate wisdom through consistent behavior. The proverb can be applied to situations where people contradict their own positive actions with inappropriate claims or behaviors, teaching that integrity requires alignment between our actions and words.\n\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce Yoruba cultural values regarding proper behavior, particularly for elders. The first phrase addresses self-deception, while the second emphasizes elders' responsibility to maintain proper standards. Together, they frame the proverb within the broader Yoruba ethical framework of wisdom, consistency, and integrity.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed w\u1eb9w\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1n k\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 j\u1eb9 si\" translates to \"An elder doesn't finish washing their hands and then claim they will eat with dirty hands.\" It teaches that we should maintain consistency between our actions and words, especially those in positions of wisdom or authority.

This phrase involves someone being sold, with the money used to buy a lamp (\u00e0t\u00f9p\u00e0), and then the person claiming they'll be waking up to light the lamp at night.\n3. The structure suggests irony - someone in a bad situation (being sold into slavery) yet claiming they'll have a responsibility or burden (lighting lamps at night).\n4. This helps understand that the proverb likely deals with ironic situations where someone suffers a major loss yet focuses on a minor inconvenience.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb uses the literary device of irony to comment on human tendency to miss the bigger picture when facing hardship.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The person who is sold and the money is used to buy a machete: he says the machete is causing him suffering.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The second similar phrase \"\u1eb8ni \u00e0 b\u00e1 t\u00e0 k\u00e1 fow\u00f3-o r\u1eb9\u0300 ra \u00e8b\u00f9: \u00f3 n\u00ed \u00e8l\u00e9 \u00f2\u00fan k\u00f3 \u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301d\u00fanr\u00fan\" continues the pattern of irony.\n2. Here, someone is sold and the money is used to buy yams (\u00e8b\u00f9), and then the person complains about having to count five hundred yams.\n3. This reinforces the theme of misplaced concern - being more worried about a minor inconvenience (counting yams) than the major tragedy (being sold).\n4. Both similar phrases help establish that the proverb is about someone who misses the fundamental problem while focusing on a trivial consequence.\n\nInterim Insight: These proverbs use dramatic irony to highlight how people sometimes focus on minor inconveniences while ignoring catastrophic situations affecting them.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The person who is sold and the money is used to buy a machete: he says the machete is causing him suffering.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb uses irony to criticize people who miss the main issue while complaining about a minor consequence. The person in the proverb has been sold into slavery (a catastrophic life event), yet is concerned about the suffering caused by the machete that was purchased with the money from their sale. The proverb teaches about proper perspective and priorities - warning against focusing on trivial matters while ignoring the fundamental problems. In Yoruba wisdom tradition, this reflects the importance of clear thinking and proper assessment of one's situation. It can be applied to situations where people misidentify the true source of their problems or fail to recognize the gravity of their circumstances.\n\n- References: The pattern is consistent across all three examples - someone is sold, the money buys something (machete/lamp/yams), and then the person complains about a minor issue related to that item rather than the fact they were sold into slavery.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8ni \u00e0 b\u00e1 t\u00e0 k\u00e1 fow\u00f3-o r\u1eb9\u0300 ra \u00e0d\u00e1: \u00f3 n\u00ed \u00ecy\u00e0 \u00e0d\u00e1 \u0144j\u1eb9 \u00f2un\" translates to \"The person who is sold and the money is used to buy a machete: he says the machete is causing him suffering.\" It criticizes the human tendency to focus on minor inconveniences while ignoring major calamities. The profound irony in the proverb serves as a teaching tool about maintaining proper perspective in life and correctly identifying the true source of one's problems."

This suggests a theme of maintaining dignity or pride even in difficult situations - the ram would rather die than make a sound showing weakness.\n3. The imagery conveys choosing a difficult but dignified option over one that might be easier but humiliating.\n4. This helps me understand the original proverb likely contrasts two choices: submission to someone (prostrating to the Gambari/Hausa person) versus maintaining dignity even at great cost.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb appears to be about choosing death with dignity over living with humiliation or submission.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Rather than prostrate (bow down) for a Hausa man (Gambari), it's better to endure and die.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"K\u00e1 r\u00edni s\u1ecd\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300 f\u00fanni \u00f2 d\u00e0b\u00ed-i k\u00e1 s\u1ecd\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300 f\u00fanni k\u00e1 gb\u00e0\" translates to \"Having someone to speak to is not the same as having someone who listens and accepts what you say.\"\n2. This proverb emphasizes the distinction between superficial interaction and genuine understanding or respect.\n3. In relation to the original proverb, it suggests there's a cultural context about relationships between different ethnic groups (Yoruba and Hausa) where true respect might be lacking.\n4. It adds a layer about dignity and being acknowledged properly versus merely going through motions of respect without genuine reciprocity.\n\nInterim Insight: The original proverb likely refers to maintaining one's cultural dignity rather than submitting to someone who may not truly respect you or your culture.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Rather than prostrate before a Hausa man (in humiliation), it is better to face hardship and die with dignity.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb reflects the historical ethnic tensions between Yoruba and Hausa peoples in Nigeria. In Yoruba culture, prostrating is a sign of respect, but the proverb suggests that maintaining one's dignity and cultural integrity is more important than submitting to someone who may not reciprocate that respect. It speaks to the importance of honor and self-respect in Yoruba culture, suggesting that death with dignity is preferable to life with humiliation. The proverb teaches that one should not compromise fundamental values and personal dignity even in challenging circumstances.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of dignity before submission, while Similar Phrase 2 highlights the importance of genuine respect rather than superficial acknowledgment in interpersonal relationships."

The similar phrase roughly translates to \"It is the excessive person who worships beyond the devil's bottom; one who carries sacrifice beyond knows not where to place it.\" This speaks to excess and going beyond reasonable boundaries.\n2. This phrase warns against excess, suggesting there's wisdom in moderation and knowing appropriate limits.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase indicates that Yoruba proverbs often warn against excess or persistence in inappropriate directions. This suggests our main proverb may similarly address persistence that leads to negative outcomes.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Refusing-to-leave kills the mosquito; refusing-to-leave kills the bush rat; refusing-to-leave kills the wildcat.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: Ak\u00fa, nk\u00f2 n\u00ed omitooro-o r\u1eb9\u0300 \u1eb9\u0301 l\u00e1; \u00e0\u00eck\u00fa, nk\u00f2 n\u00ed\u00ed p\u00e8 \u00e9 r\u00e1n n\u00ed\u1e63\u1eb9\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second phrase roughly translates to \"If it dies, I will not lick its sweetness; if it doesn't die, I will not send it on errands.\" This speaks to a neutral stance or disengagement from situations beyond one's control.\n2. It conveys wisdom about knowing when to detach from situations, suggesting that sometimes neither involvement nor expectation is the wisest course.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase reinforces the idea that knowing when to engage or disengage is crucial in Yoruba wisdom. Combined with our main proverb, it suggests that persistent engagement in dangerous situations leads to negative consequences.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Refusing to leave kills the mosquito; refusing to leave kills the bush rat; refusing to leave kills the wildcat.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb teaches about the dangers of staying too long in harmful situations or contexts. It uses a progression of increasingly powerful animals (mosquito, bush rat, wildcat) to show that persistence in danger is perilous regardless of one's strength or status. The wisdom conveyed is that knowing when to retreat or disengage is crucial for survival. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would be used to advise against stubbornness, overstaying one's welcome, or persisting in situations that have become dangerous or unproductive.\n\n- References: The similar phrases reinforce the Yoruba cultural emphasis on moderation, appropriate timing, and strategic disengagement. Like the main proverb, they speak to the wisdom of knowing boundaries and limits.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-k\u00far\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144pa \u1eb9m\u1ecd\u0301n; \u00e0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-k\u00far\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144pa \u00e0f\u00e8; \u00e0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-k\u00far\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144pa m\u00e1l\u00e1\u00e0j\u00fa\" translates to \"Refusing to leave kills the mosquito; refusing to leave kills the bush rat; refusing to leave kills the wildcat.\" It teaches that persistence in dangerous situations leads to harm regardless of one's strength or position.

It emphasizes that inappropriate responses or misplaced actions don't solve problems.\n3. It reinforces the theme of proper order, placement, and function - things should be used according to their intended purpose.\n\nInterim Insight: This further confirms the main proverb is about maintaining proper sequence, hygiene, and not misusing objects in ways that contaminate or confuse their purpose.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One should not use the same finger to clean the ear, then the nose, and then pick the teeth.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches about proper hygiene, order, and not contaminating one situation with elements from another. It advises against cross-contamination, both literally and metaphorically. In Yoruba culture, it emphasizes the importance of keeping boundaries between different aspects of life and not carrying problems or impurities from one domain to another. The proverb warns against improper sequence of actions that can lead to harmful consequences or contamination. At a deeper level, it counsels maintaining clear boundaries in relationships, problem-solving, and ethical conduct.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of proper order and not confusing processes, while Similar Phrase 2 emphasizes the importance of using things according to their proper function and not misplacing actions.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed fi \u00ecka ro et\u00ed, k\u00e1 fi ro im\u00fa, k\u00e1 w\u00e1 t\u00fan fi ta eh\u00edn\" translates to \"One should not use the same finger to clean the ear, then the nose, and then pick the teeth.\" It teaches about maintaining proper boundaries, hygiene, and order. In Yoruba wisdom, it cautions against cross-contamination, both literally in terms of physical hygiene and metaphorically in terms of not mixing problems from different areas of life.

This proverb establishes natural order and proper behavior - things have their proper time, place, and nature.\n3. It suggests that things should act according to their true nature, not pretend to be what they are not.\n4. This adds a moral dimension to our main proverb - pretending to be something you're not goes against natural order.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely warns against pretense and emphasizes the importance of authenticity and accepting one's true nature.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"\u1e62\u00e0k\u00ec (cloth) pretends to be velvet, bones pretend to be meat.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against false appearances and pretense. Just as common cloth cannot truly be luxurious velvet, and dry bones cannot be succulent meat, people should not pretend to be what they are not. In Yoruba culture, authenticity is highly valued, and this proverb cautions against deception and false pretenses. It reminds people to recognize the true nature of things and not be fooled by outward appearances. The proverb could be applied to situations where someone or something is pretending to have qualities or value they do not actually possess.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 supports the structure of comparison between imitation and authentic items, while Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the cultural value of natural order and authentic behavior.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u1e62\u00e0k\u00ec \u0144\u1e63e b\u00ed \u1ecd\u0300r\u00e1, egungun \u0144\u1e63e b\u00ed \u1eb9ran\" translates to \"Common cloth pretends to be velvet, bones pretend to be meat.\" It warns against deception and false appearances, emphasizing the Yoruba cultural value of authenticity. It teaches that no matter how much something tries to imitate something else of higher value, its true nature cannot be changed, and discerning people will recognize the difference."

The similar phrase \"Aaka \u00f2 gb\u00e9 \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n; igb\u00f3 n\u00ed \u0144gb\u00e9\" translates to \"The crab doesn't live in the savanna; it lives in the forest/bush.\" This speaks to natural order and things being in their proper place.\n2. This suggests the main proverb may deal with consequences of stepping outside one's natural domain or acting outside one's authority.\n3. Both phrases seem to emphasize natural order and the consequences of violating it.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the proverb likely relates to proper domains, boundaries, and the consequences that come from overstepping them.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The hastiness/impatience of the household head is what leads to encountering misfortune/trouble on the journey.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0gb\u00e0-\u00ecy\u00e0 t\u00ed \u0144m\u00f9k\u1ecd \u1ecd\u0300n\u00edn\u00ed, \u00f3 n\u00ed n\u00edtor\u00ed omi gb\u00edgb\u00f3n\u00e1 or\u00ed-i r\u1eb9\u0300 ni.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second phrase translates roughly as \"The elderly person drinking hot soup says it's because of the hot water that has passed over their head.\" This refers to someone who has experienced difficulties before and thus can handle current challenges.\n2. This connects to the main proverb by referencing experience, patience, and consequences. The household head (ba\u00e1l\u00e9) who rushes may lack the wisdom that comes from experience.\n3. Both phrases emphasize cause and effect relationships in behavior and the wisdom that comes from understanding these connections.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the importance of patience and experience in leadership, suggesting that the hasty household head encounters trouble precisely because they lack the wisdom to proceed carefully.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The hastiness of the household head is what leads to encountering misfortune on the journey.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against impulsive leadership and hasty decision-making. In Yoruba culture, the household head (ba\u00e1l\u00e9) holds significant authority and responsibility. When such a person acts rashly without proper deliberation, they not only endanger themselves but also those under their authority. The proverb teaches that patience, thoughtful consideration, and proper timing are essential qualities of effective leadership. Just as creatures belong in their natural habitats (as in the first supporting phrase), and just as experience breeds wisdom (as in the second phrase), leaders must exercise patience and good judgment to avoid unnecessary troubles.\n\n- References: The crab belongs in the forest, not the savanna; The elder who drinks hot soup has experienced hotter water before.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u1ecc\u0300y\u00e1j\u00fa-u ba\u00e1l\u00e9 n\u00ed \u0144p\u00e0d\u00e9 \u00ecb\u00f2s\u00ed l\u1ecd\u0301n\u00e0\" means \"The hastiness of the household head leads to encountering misfortune on the journey.\" This Yoruba wisdom cautions against impulsive leadership, teaching that when those in authority act rashly without proper consideration, they invite trouble. In Yoruba culture, the household head's decisions affect the entire family, making patience and careful deliberation essential virtues for anyone in a position of authority. The proverb reminds leaders that haste often leads to regrettable consequences that could have been avoided with proper patience and foresight."

This similar phrase speaks about shame and consequences of behavior affecting not just the individual but their community.\n2. It suggests a social responsibility where one's actions reflect on others and have wider consequences.\n3. The phrase emphasizes how ignoring social norms leads to negative outcomes.\n4. There's an element of hierarchy and respect implied - when expected behaviors aren't followed, social disorder results.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase indicates that the main proverb likely deals with proper social conduct, especially regarding respect for established social hierarchies and the consequences of failing to observe them.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"An elder who refuses to greet the king is tying a rope around himself.\" (Or more directly: \"An elder who doesn't greet the Aare is using a rope to bury himself.\")\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \"\u1ecc\u0300k\u00e1nj\u00faw\u00e0 \u00e0gb\u00e0 n\u00ed \u0144s\u1ecd ara \u1eb9\u0300 d\u00e8we.\" (It is a stubborn elder who reduces himself to the status of a child.)\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase discusses how an elder's inappropriate behavior can diminish their own status.\n2. It points to the Yoruba concept that wisdom and proper conduct are expected to increase with age.\n3. When elders act inappropriately, they undermine their own position in society.\n4. This relates strongly to the main proverb - both involve elders failing to act according to their status.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase clarifies that the main proverb is specifically about how elders who don't observe proper protocols (like greeting authority figures) are actively harming their own standing and bringing consequences upon themselves.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"An elder who refuses to greet the king is preparing for his own funeral.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb teaches about the importance of showing proper respect to authority figures in Yoruba culture. The \"Aare\" is a title for a high chief or king, and greeting elders and authority figures is a fundamental aspect of Yoruba social etiquette. When an elder refuses to show this basic respect, they are metaphorically preparing for their own demise - both socially and potentially literally. The proverb highlights how pride and refusal to acknowledge established hierarchies leads to self-destruction. In Yoruba society, such behavior would lead to social isolation and loss of status, effectively a form of social death.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase demonstrates how improper behavior brings shame, while the second clarifies how elders are especially expected to model proper conduct, and failure to do so diminishes their status to that of immature individuals.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 t\u00ed \u00f2 k\u00ed \u00c0\u00e0r\u1eb9 \u0144fi ok\u00f9n sin ara-a r\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"An elder who refuses to greet the king is preparing for his own funeral.\" It emphasizes that refusing to show proper respect to authority figures, especially when you yourself hold elevated status as an elder, is self-destructive. In Yoruba culture, this represents a serious breach of social norms that would result in loss of status and social standing - a metaphorical death within the community."

This phrase contrasts the capabilities of a lazy person versus a strong, energetic person, showing how energy and strength determine what can be accomplished.\n3. The contrast suggests that having strength/energy (\u00e1p\u00e1) is crucial for productivity, just as our main proverb mentions \"\u00e1p\u00e1\" (strength/arm).\n\nInterim Insight: Both phrases emphasize how physical capability and energy determine productivity. The similar phrase suggests that when someone has strength, they can accomplish significant tasks, while laziness results in minimal output.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"It is lack of strength that makes the machete not cut; if we have strength, a cotton plant is enough to cut a tree.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed ba\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300-\u1eb9\u0301 b\u00e1 \u0144t\u00e0k\u00ect\u00ec, \u00f2r\u00f3gi l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e1 \u1eb9m\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"If the head of the house is stomping/dancing vigorously, we use a tree trunk to respond to the rhythm.\"\n2. This proverb suggests that when a leader shows energy and enthusiasm, followers respond with even greater effort or commitment.\n3. It reinforces the idea that energy and strength (as in the main proverb) influence outcomes and determine what can be accomplished.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase adds the cultural value of energy begetting energy, and how determination can overcome apparent limitations. It's not just about physical strength but also about enthusiasm and commitment to a task.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It is lack of strength that makes the machete not cut; if we have strength, even a cotton plant is enough to cut a tree.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that limitations often come from lack of effort or determination rather than external circumstances. Just as a machete fails to cut not because it's blunt but because the wielder lacks strength, our failures may result from insufficient effort. The cotton plant (soft) cutting a tree (hard) is a powerful metaphor showing that with sufficient determination and energy, even seemingly inadequate tools can accomplish difficult tasks. The proverb emphasizes the Yoruba cultural value of diligence, perseverance, and the belief that human will and effort can overcome apparent limitations.\n\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce this interpretation by contrasting productivity with energy levels and showing how determination can transcend apparent limitations, reflecting the Yoruba emphasis on diligence and personal agency in achieving success.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe proverb \"\u00c0\u00ec-l\u00e1p\u00e1 l\u00e0d\u00e1 \u00f2 m\u00fa; b\u00ed a b\u00e1 l\u00e1p\u00e1, \u1ecdm\u1ecd ow\u00fa to-o g\u00e9gi\" translates to \"It is lack of strength that makes the machete not cut; if we have strength, even a cotton plant is enough to cut a tree.\" This proverb teaches that our limitations often stem from insufficient effort rather than external circumstances.

This reflects the cultural values of diligence, perseverance, and the belief in human agency to overcome obstacles through sustained effort and determination."

The similar phrase translates to \"If a child wants to behave like an elder, his age won't permit it\" - suggesting natural limitations based on one's position\n2. This speaks to the Yoruba understanding of hierarchy and proper positioning in society - everyone has their place\n3. The structure \"B\u00ed...b\u00e1 f\u1eb9\u0301...\" (If...wants to...) appears in both proverbs, suggesting a parallel about inappropriate desires or attempts to overstep boundaries\n\nInterim Insight: The main proverb likely concerns someone of lower status (\u00ecl\u00e0r\u00ed - a palace attendant/servant) attempting something beyond their station, similar to how the child in the similar phrase attempts to act above their age/position.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"If a palace attendant/servant wants to rebel/rise up, people ask, 'What can the king do?'\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed \u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301run \u00f2 \u1e63e \u1eb9ni n\u00ed baba, \u00e0 fi \u00ecy\u00e0nj\u00fa \u1e63e b\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase translates to \"If God hasn't made someone a father, one strives to act like an elder\" - showing how people might try to compensate for their positions\n2. It suggests that despite predetermined social positions, people attempt to elevate themselves through effort or rebellion\n3. The concept of divine or natural order appears in both - in the similar phrase, it's God's determination; in the main proverb, it's the established political hierarchy\n\nInterim Insight: The main proverb explores power dynamics and potential rebellion, questioning what authority (the king) can do when subordinates (palace attendants) challenge the established order.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"If a palace servant decides to rebel, people ask, 'What can the king do about it?'\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb reflects on the vulnerability of authority when faced with rebellion from those meant to serve it. It suggests that even kings have limitations to their power if those under them collectively decide to revolt. The proverb serves as both a warning about the fragility of power and a reflection on the responsibility of leadership. In Yoruba culture, which traditionally respected hierarchical authority but also valued collective action, this proverb captures the tension between established order and the potential for upheaval when subordinates reject their position.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of social positioning and limitations based on one's station. Similar Phrase 2 highlights how people attempt to transcend their designated roles through effort or rebellion, adding complexity to the power dynamics expressed in the main proverb.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"B\u00ed \u00ecl\u00e0r\u00ed b\u00e1 f\u1eb9\u0301 t\u1eb9\u0301, a n\u00ed k\u00ed l\u1ecdba \u00f3 \u1e63e?\" translates to \"If a palace servant decides to rebel, people ask, 'What can the king do about it?'\" It speaks to the limitations of authority when faced with rebellion from subordinates. In Yoruba political philosophy, this proverb acknowledges that even the most powerful ruler depends on the cooperation of those beneath them, and when that social contract breaks down, traditional power structures can be threatened. The proverb serves as a reminder that legitimate leadership requires not just formal authority but also the continued consent of followers."

This proverb, like our main one, deals with social boundaries, proper justifications, and the limitations of what can be reasonably explained away.\n3. It reinforces the idea of social order and the inappropriateness of certain claims or behaviors.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase confirms our main proverb is about social boundaries and proper place - emphasizing that there are clear limits to what certain individuals can claim or access based on their social position.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Except for what is not sold in the market, a slave does not eat.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to social boundaries and status limitations in traditional society. It means that people of lower status (symbolized by slaves) should not have access to rare or forbidden items that even free people cannot obtain. More broadly, it teaches that everyone, regardless of position, must respect certain boundaries and limitations. In modern context, it reminds us that there are universal limitations that apply to everyone, and no one should expect special privileges beyond what is naturally available to all.\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce concepts of social boundaries, proper behavior within one's station, and the natural limitations that govern all members of society regardless of status.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe proverb \"\u00c0fi ohun t\u00ed a k\u00ec \u00ed t\u00e0 l\u1ecd\u0301j\u00e0 l\u1eb9r\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\" translates to \"Except for what is not sold in the market, a slave does not eat.\" This Yoruba wisdom teaches about social boundaries and universal limitations. It means that even those of lower status shouldn't expect access to things unavailable to everyone else. The proverb establishes that certain limitations apply universally - if something is so rare or forbidden that it's not even available in the marketplace for free people, then those of lower status certainly shouldn't expect access to it. In contemporary application, it reminds us that there are natural boundaries in life that apply to everyone, and we shouldn't expect special exceptions beyond what is reasonably available to all."

This phrase speaks to proper social relations and hierarchy - a visitor shouldn't assume authority or cause embarrassment to their host.\n3. The structure follows a similar pattern to our proverb, using \"k\u00ec \u00ed\" (does not) and \"d\u00e1n\u00ed\" (put to shame).\n4. Both proverbs appear to be about maintaining proper order in relationships.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely deals with proper roles and boundaries, where one entity should not overstep its position to embarrass or disadvantage another.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The hawk does not swoop down so that the chicken can catch insects to shame (someone).\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00f2 b\u00e1 \u1e63e ohun \u1eb9\u0300r\u00f9, \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed s\u00e1.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00f2 b\u00e1 \u1e63e ohun \u1eb9\u0300r\u00f9, \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed s\u00e1\" translates to \"If an elder doesn't do something frightening, a child won't run away.\"\n2. This proverb speaks to cause and effect, particularly related to authority figures and their influence on others' behavior.\n3. It suggests that people in power create the conditions for others' reactions.\n4. This helps us understand our main proverb: the hawk (powerful predator) creates conditions that affect the chicken's behavior.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb appears to be about power dynamics, where the powerful (hawk) should not create situations that lead to embarrassment by enabling lesser beings (chickens) to act beyond their station.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A hawk does not swoop down merely for a chicken to catch insects and put someone to shame.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to proper social order and hierarchy. The hawk is a powerful predator while the chicken is prey. The natural order is for hawks to hunt chickens, not to help them catch insects. The proverb teaches that those in positions of power should not diminish themselves to elevate those beneath them in ways that disrupt social harmony. It warns against inverting natural hierarchies or enabling those of lower status to embarrass or challenge those above them. The wisdom reminds us that each person has their proper role in society, and attempting to reverse these roles leads to disorder and shame.\n\n- References: The interpretation draws from both \"\u00c0lej\u00f2 k\u00ec \u00ed l\u1ecd k\u00f3 m\u00fa on\u00edl\u00e9 d\u00e1n\u00ed\" (a visitor shouldn't shame their host) and \"B\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00f2 b\u00e1 \u1e63e ohun \u1eb9\u0300r\u00f9, \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed s\u00e1\" (elders' actions determine children's reactions), highlighting Yoruba cultural values around social order, respect for hierarchy, and proper conduct between those of different statuses."

This similar phrase speaks to natural order and appropriate environments - each thing has its place and context where it thrives.\n2. It suggests that elements work properly in their rightful place, implying that proper function depends on accepting one's natural role or position.\n3. The imagery contrasts the savanna (open space) with the forest (structured ecosystem) - suggesting ordered systems versus chaos.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase establishes a context of natural order and the importance of accepting the proper nature of things rather than rejecting established wisdom.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One may speak of inheritance, one may speak of wisdom, but 'I don't want it, I won't accept it' is how a fool ends a matter.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: K\u00ed ni or\u00ed \u0144\u1e63e t\u00ed \u00e8j\u00eck\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u00e8 \u1e63e? \u00c8j\u00eck\u00e1 ru \u1eb9r\u00f9 \u00f3 gba \u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301d\u00fanr\u00fan; or\u00ed ta ti\u1eb9\u0300 n\u00ed og\u00fanl\u00fagba.\n(What can the head do that the shoulders cannot? The shoulders carry loads worth five hundred cowries; the head sells its own for just twenty.)\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase contrasts the head (representing thinking/wisdom) with shoulders (representing physical strength/labor).\n2. It suggests that wisdom (the head) is actually more valuable than mere physical capability, despite appearances.\n3. The numerical values (500 vs. 20) create irony - what seems more capable (shoulders) is actually less valuable than wisdom (the head).\n\nInterim Insight: This adds the dimension that rejecting wisdom (as in the main proverb) is foolish because wisdom is ultimately more valuable than stubborn resistance or physical strength.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One may offer inheritance, one may offer wisdom, but 'I don't want it, I won't accept it' is how a fool ends a matter.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb criticizes the foolishness of rejecting advice, wisdom, or beneficial legacies out of stubbornness or pride. In Yoruba culture, wisdom (\u1ecdgb\u1ecdn) and inheritance/tradition (og\u00fan) are valued resources that contribute to success and well-being. The proverb teaches that only a fool would summarily dismiss these valuable resources without consideration. Just as the vine needs the forest (Similar Phrase 1), people need to accept and work within established wisdom. And just as the head's wisdom exceeds the shoulders' strength in value (Similar Phrase 2), accepting guidance and inheritance brings greater benefit than stubborn rejection. The proverb ultimately cautions against the pride and close-mindedness that leads people to reject beneficial counsel.\n\n- References: The interpretation draws on the ecological harmony referenced in Similar Phrase 1 and the value hierarchy established in Similar Phrase 2 to explain why rejecting wisdom and inheritance is considered foolish in Yoruba thought."

This suggests a cultural context where social inclusion or exclusion is based on affection or preference.\n3. It indicates that in Yoruba culture, those who are not favored might be excluded from important conversations or decisions.\n4. This similar phrase emphasizes the consequences of not being the preferred person in a situation.\n\nInterim Insight: There appears to be a cultural theme about differential treatment based on preference or favor, where being the favored one grants privileges and inclusion.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The person that we love/want is different from the person who says there is no one like him/her.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eb8ni t\u00ed a \u00f2 f\u1eb9\u0301 n\u00edl\u00f9\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed j\u00f3 l\u00f3j\u00fa agbo.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eb8ni t\u00ed a \u00f2 f\u1eb9\u0301 n\u00edl\u00f9\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed j\u00f3 l\u00f3j\u00fa agbo\" translates to \"The person who is not wanted/loved in town does not dance in the public square.\"\n2. This proverb reinforces the idea that those who aren't favored by the community don't get to showcase themselves publicly.\n3. It adds the dimension of public performance and recognition being tied to social acceptance.\n4. There's an implication of community consensus about who is valued and who isn't.\n\nInterim Insight: The cultural context emphasizes how community perception determines someone's opportunities for expression and recognition. Self-assessment differs from how others perceive and value you.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The person we love is different from the person who claims there is no one like them.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the disconnect between self-perception and external validation. It suggests that people who boast about their uniqueness or superiority (\"there is no one like me\") may not actually be the ones who are truly valued or loved by others. In Yoruba culture, community opinion often matters more than self-assessment. The proverb serves as a humbling reminder that our own high opinion of ourselves doesn't necessarily align with how others see us. It cautions against arrogance and self-importance, emphasizing that genuine affection and respect from others is more meaningful than self-proclaimed greatness.\n\n- References: The similar phrases reinforce this interpretation by showing how those who aren't favored by the community face exclusion (Similar Phrase 1) and aren't given platforms for public expression (Similar Phrase 2), regardless of their self-perception.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u1eb8ni t\u00ed a f\u1eb9\u0301 y\u00e0t\u1ecd\u0300 s\u00ed \u1eb9ni t\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f2 s\u00ed ir\u00fa \u00f2un\" translates to \"The person we love is different from the person who claims there is no one like them.\" It reveals the Yoruba cultural wisdom about the gap between self-importance and actual community valuation. It warns that those who boast about their uniqueness may not be the ones truly valued by the community. This reflects the Yoruba emphasis on humility and the importance of community validation over self-aggrandizement. The proverb serves as a reminder that how others perceive us often matters more than our perception of ourselves in traditional Yoruba social contexts."

This relates to how sacred things maintain their power by being set apart or not overly familiar.\n3. The phrase teaches about boundaries and respect in relationships, especially with authority figures or sacred entities.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests a cultural value that maintains respect requires some level of distance or boundary. This may inform our understanding of \"\u00c0g\u00f9nb\u00e1nir\u1ecd\u0300 n\u00ed \u0144foj\u00fadini\" as potentially dealing with relationships, boundaries, or respect.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A person who climbs onto another's back is the one who sees ahead.\" (\u00c0g\u00f9nb\u00e1 = one who climbs on back, nir\u1ecd\u0300 = on another, n\u00ed = is, \u0144foj\u00fadini = sees ahead)\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00ccp\u00e9\u01f9p\u00e9j\u00fa \u00f2 n\u00ed enini; \u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 ir\u00f9ngb\u1ecd\u0300n \u00f2 \u1e63e \u00f2l\u00f2\u00f3.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00ccp\u00e9\u01f9p\u00e9j\u00fa \u00f2 n\u00ed enini; \u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 ir\u00f9ngb\u1ecd\u0300n \u00f2 \u1e63e \u00f2l\u00f2\u00f3\" translates to \"A brief moment doesn't have depth; an elder with a gray beard isn't automatically wise.\" \n2. This proverb cautions against superficial judgments or assumptions based merely on appearances or status.\n3. It emphasizes that true wisdom or understanding comes from more than just external markers or position.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase adds the cultural nuance that position alone (like being an elder) doesn't guarantee wisdom. Similarly, in our target proverb, the person who climbs on another's back gains perspective not through their own merit but through their position relative to others.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The person who rides on another's back is the one who sees farther.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the advantages gained through relationships with others. It acknowledges that people achieve greater vision or perspective not solely through their own abilities but by \"standing on the shoulders\" of others. However, when paired with the context phrases, there's a deeper meaning: while those who leverage others may see farther, this position doesn't necessarily confer real wisdom or respect. The proverb can be used to comment on people who achieve visibility or advantage through others rather than their own merit. It serves as both an acknowledgment of interdependence in society and a subtle critique of those who use others for personal advancement.\n\n- References: The interpretation is informed by \"\u00c0k\u00ed\u00ecj\u1eb9\u0301 m\u00fa \u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0 n\u00edy\u00ec\" (respect requires distance) and \"\u00ccp\u00e9\u01f9p\u00e9j\u00fa \u00f2 n\u00ed enini; \u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 ir\u00f9ngb\u1ecd\u0300n \u00f2 \u1e63e \u00f2l\u00f2\u00f3\" (position alone doesn't guarantee wisdom)."

Both proverbs mention \"\u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n\" (rope or vine) and \"erin\" (elephant), establishing a contrast between something seemingly strong (a tall rope) and something much stronger (an elephant).\n3. The similar phrase adds the imagery of \"\u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n\" (savannah) which suggests an elephant's natural habitat and movement.\n\nInterim Insight: This proverb appears to use the contrast between a rope's height and an elephant's strength to illustrate the futility of weak restrictions against determined forces. The repeated structure emphasizes that attempting to restrain something beyond your capacity leads to you being dragged along with it.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n\nTranslation: \"A rope as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant from going; the rope that says an elephant should not go to Alo, will go along with the elephant.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1ecck\u00f9nrin k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00e9, ak\u1ecd igi k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63oje\" translates to \"A man does not cry, a male tree does not produce sap.\" This proverb speaks to expected behaviors based on inherent nature.\n2. This adds cultural context about Yoruba perceptions of natural order and inherent qualities - just as a male tree naturally doesn't produce sap, certain outcomes are predetermined by nature.\n3. When paired with our main proverb, it suggests that attempting to prevent what is natural or inevitable (like an elephant's movement) is futile - one cannot change the fundamental nature of things.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces the idea that trying to prevent something from expressing its natural strength or tendency is futile. The elephant will go where it wants to go because that is its nature, just as a male tree doesn't produce sap.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n\n- Final Translation: \"A rope as tall as a palm tree cannot prevent an elephant from going; the rope that insists an elephant should not go to Alo will end up going along with the elephant.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches about the futility of attempting to restrain forces beyond one's control. In Yoruba culture, the elephant symbolizes great power and unstoppable determination. The palm tree, though tall and significant, represents inadequate restraint. The proverb warns against trying to control what is beyond your capacity, as you may find yourself dragged along instead. It counsels wisdom in recognizing limitations and respecting natural order. The proverb could apply to interpersonal relationships, governance, or any situation where one might overestimate their ability to control powerful forces or determined individuals.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the contrast between attempted restraint (rope/chains) and unstoppable force (elephant). Similar Phrase 2 adds cultural context about natural order and the futility of opposing inherent qualities or tendencies."

The similar phrase \"B\u00ed a k\u00f2 b\u00e1 t\u00f3 baba \u1ecdm\u1ecd\u1ecd\u0301 \u1e63e, a k\u00ec \u00ed pe al\u00e1k\u00e0r\u00e0\" translates to \"If you can't reach the child's father, you don't call the bean cake seller.\" This suggests proper order or protocol in Yoruba culture.\n2. This phrase emphasizes the importance of doing things in the right order or following the proper hierarchy, which may relate to our target proverb's meaning.\n3. The similar phrase warns against skipping steps or bypassing authority figures, suggesting a cultural value of respecting proper procedures.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that the target proverb may also be about proper sequence, procedures, or focusing on the primary task before moving to secondary concerns.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"If one is pounding yam, the feet should not be sticking out.\" or \"When pounding yam, one's foot shouldn't be protruding.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed a b\u00e1 d\u00e0gb\u00e0 \u00e0 y\u00e9 ogun-\u00fan j\u00e0.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second similar phrase translates to \"When one grows old, one understands how to fight battles\" or \"With age comes wisdom about which battles to fight.\"\n2. This suggests learning from experience and gaining wisdom about proper approaches to challenges.\n3. This relates to our target proverb by reinforcing the importance of proper technique and focus - just as the elderly know which battles to choose, one should know how to properly pound yam (keeping feet tucked in for safety and proper form).\n4. In both phrases, there's a lesson about proper execution of tasks based on knowledge and attention.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb is likely advising complete concentration and proper technique when performing important tasks, similar to how experience teaches one to approach challenges correctly.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"When pounding yam, one's feet should not be sticking out.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb uses the common household activity of pounding yam (a staple food) to teach a broader lesson about focus and proper procedure. Pounding yam requires concentration and proper form - if one's feet are sticking out, it indicates improper technique and risk of injury. The proverb advises that when undertaking any important task, one should be fully committed, follow proper procedures, and avoid distractions or carelessness. It teaches the value of doing things properly and with full attention rather than haphazardly or with divided focus. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the emphasis on thoroughness and proper execution of tasks.\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce the cultural importance of proper order (Similar Phrase 1) and the wisdom of correct approaches to tasks (Similar Phrase 2).\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 \u0144g\u00fany\u00e1n, k\u00f2m\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300 \u00e1 y\u1ecd\" translates to \"When pounding yam, one's feet should not be sticking out.\" It uses the culturally significant activity of food preparation to teach about proper focus and technique. In Yoruba society, pounding yam is done in a mortar while sitting on a low stool - if one's feet are sticking out, it shows poor form and creates risk. The proverb advises complete concentration on important tasks, proper execution, and avoiding divided attention. It embodies the Yoruba cultural value of thoroughness and careful attention to process in all endeavors."

This similar phrase speaks about a young foal that doesn't understand consequences - while its mother is restrained, it roams freely eating grass.\n2. There's a theme of youthful ignorance or inexperience - the foal doesn't recognize that its freedom depends on its mother's restriction.\n3. The phrase suggests a generational disconnect where the young doesn't appreciate the sacrifices or limitations of parents/elders.\n\nInterim Insight: Both proverbs likely deal with inexperience, particularly of youth, and how this leads to inappropriate or unsustainable behavior that doesn't recognize consequences or proper social order.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A child who has never seen soup (preparation) that splashes palm oil on their chest.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \"Aj\u00e1 r\u00ed epo k\u00f2 l\u00e1; \u00ecy\u00e1-a r\u1eb9\u0300\u1eb9\u0301 \u1e63u ih\u00e1 b\u00ed.\"\n(A dog sees palm oil but doesn't lick it; its mother gave birth to a fool.)\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase refers to palm oil (epo), which is also mentioned in our main proverb.\n2. In Yoruba culture, palm oil is valuable - a dog that doesn't lick it is considered foolish or unusual.\n3. The phrase suggests that proper behavior toward valuable things is expected and natural - going against this natural inclination indicates something is wrong.\n4. Both phrases involve relationships with palm oil that reveal character or experience.\n\nInterim Insight: The main proverb likely refers to someone inexperienced who mishandles or wastes valuable resources (palm oil) due to ignorance, while experienced people would know better.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A child who has never witnessed soup preparation splashes palm oil on their chest.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb criticizes someone who mishandles valuable resources due to inexperience. In Yoruba culture, palm oil is precious and used carefully in cooking. Someone who has never seen soup prepared properly might carelessly splash the oil on themselves rather than in the pot. This represents inexperienced people who waste resources, make mistakes, or act inappropriately because they lack proper training or understanding. It's a commentary on how proper knowledge comes from observation and experience, and those without it often make wasteful or foolish decisions.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase shows how youth often don't understand consequences of their actions, while the second emphasizes how proper treatment of valuable resources (like palm oil) is expected from those with sense and proper upbringing.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u1eccm\u1ecd \u00e0\u00ec-j\u1ecdb\u1eb9\u0300-r\u00ed t\u00ed \u0144ja epo s\u00e1y\u00e0\" means \"A child who has never witnessed soup preparation splashes palm oil on their chest.\" It teaches that inexperience leads to waste and improper behavior. Just as someone unfamiliar with cooking might carelessly waste precious palm oil by splashing it on themselves rather than using it properly in food, people without proper knowledge or training often misuse resources or act inappropriately. The proverb emphasizes the importance of learning through observation and experience before handling valuable resources or responsibilities."

The similar phrase \"B\u00ed \u1eccya \u0144k\u1ecd l\u1ecd\u0301run, b\u00ed \u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 \u0144j\u00f3 l\u00e1y\u00e9, k\u00f2 n\u00ed\u00ed bur\u00fa f\u00fan baba k\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f3 d\u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u00f2un l\u1ecd\u0301run\" references Yoruba deities \u1eccya and \u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 in relation to a father and child.\n2. It suggests that no matter what calamities occur (symbolized by \u1eccya sewing in heaven and \u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 dancing on earth), a father would not wish misfortune upon his child.\n3. This indicates a profound parent-child relationship in Yoruba culture where a parent prioritizes their child's welfare above all.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely concerns the protective relationship between parents and children, particularly emphasizing that troubles affecting a father should not transfer to his children.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"It should not move from father's hand to say it has become the child's hand/responsibility.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A \u00f2 m\u1ecd ohun t\u00ed D\u00e1r\u00f2-\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f3 t\u00f3 w\u00ed p\u00e9 ol\u00e8-\u00e9 k\u00f3 \u00f2un\" translates to \"We don't know what Daro had before claiming that a thief stole from him.\"\n2. This phrase suggests caution about blaming others when we might not have had anything to begin with.\n3. In relation to our proverb, it hints at the idea of responsibility and accountability - not transferring one's problems or failures to others, including one's children.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the notion that our proverb addresses inappropriate transfer of burdens or responsibilities, suggesting that parents should not shift their problems to their children.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A father's burden should not become his child's responsibility.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the ethical principle that parents should bear their own responsibilities and not transfer their burdens, problems, or obligations to their children. In Yoruba culture, while children are expected to respect and support their parents, parents have a primary duty to protect their children from unnecessary hardship. The proverb cautions against parents who might use their children as scapegoats or burden them with problems that rightfully belong to the parents. It reflects the Yoruba value of appropriate responsibility-bearing across generations and the protection of the younger generation from the mistakes or difficulties of their elders.\n\n- References: The similar phrases reinforce how deeply the Yoruba culture values proper intergenerational relationships and the protection of children from undue burdens, even when faced with significant challenges (as with \u1eccya and \u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3) or the temptation to displace blame (as in the Daro example).\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"K\u00ec \u00ed d\u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301-\u1ecd baba k\u00f3 l\u00f3 di \u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 \u1ecdm\u1ecd\" translates to \"A father's burden should not become his child's responsibility.\" It emphasizes that parents should not transfer their problems, failures, or obligations to their children. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of appropriate responsibility across generations and the ethical principle that elders should protect younger ones from unnecessary hardship rather than using them as outlets for their own difficulties."

This similar phrase follows the same structure: \"It is fitting for everyone to say [something], but not fitting for [specific person].\"\n2. In this phrase, \"i\u1e63u \u00f2 jin\u00e1\" means \"yam is not hot/burning\" and \"alub\u00e0t\u00e1\" refers to a drummer who plays the talking drum.\n3. The phrase suggests that while everyone can comment on the temperature of yams, it would be inappropriate for a drummer to do so, as they should be focused on their craft.\n4. This establishes a pattern where the proverb contrasts general behavior with specialized responsibility.\n\nInterim Insight: The structure suggests our target proverb likely contrasts general communal behavior with the specialized responsibility of a particular role or person.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"It is fitting for everyone to reduce the cost of indigo dye, but not fitting for the dyer.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00d3 y\u1eb9 \u1eb9ni gbogbo k\u00f3 s\u1ecd p\u00e9 \"\u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301run a-\u1e63\u00e8kan-m\u00e1-k\u00f9,\" k\u00f2 y\u1eb9 ak\u00fak\u00f3.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second similar phrase maintains the same structure but with different content.\n2. \"\u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301run a-\u1e63\u00e8kan-m\u00e1-k\u00f9\" is a praise name for God meaning \"God who does things once and perfectly.\"\n3. \"Ak\u00fak\u00f3\" refers to a rooster, which crows repeatedly, contrasting with the once-and-perfect nature attributed to God.\n4. This reinforces the idea that these proverbs highlight contradictions between general statements and specific roles or characteristics.\n\nInterim Insight: The pattern confirms that the target proverb is about how certain actions or statements may be acceptable from the general public but inappropriate from specialists whose livelihood depends on the very thing being discussed.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It is fitting for everyone to advocate for lower prices of indigo dye, but not fitting for the dyer (whose livelihood depends on it).\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the conflict between community interests and individual professional interests. While the general public may reasonably want lower prices for goods like indigo dye, it would be self-defeating for the dyer (at\u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e9) to advocate for the same, as their livelihood depends on fair compensation for their specialized work. The proverb teaches about the importance of recognizing different perspectives based on one's position and role in society. It warns against expecting people to act against their own legitimate interests, while acknowledging that community and individual needs may sometimes be in tension.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 (about yams and drummers) and Similar Phrase 2 (about God's perfection and roosters) both follow the same pattern of contrasting general statements with specialized roles, reinforcing the interpretation of conflicting perspectives based on one's position in society.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00d3 y\u1eb9 \u1eb9ni gbogbo k\u00f3 d\u00ednw\u00f3 ar\u00f3, k\u00f2 y\u1eb9 at\u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e9\" translates to \"It is fitting for everyone to advocate for lower prices of indigo dye, but not fitting for the dyer.\" This Yoruba wisdom highlights how perspectives and appropriate behaviors differ based on one's role in society. While consumers naturally want lower prices, a craftsperson cannot reasonably devalue their own work and products. The proverb teaches respect for specialized knowledge and legitimate self-interest, while acknowledging the natural tension between community desires and professional sustainability."

This phrase highlights self-deception and the reality that no one is indispensable.\n3. It suggests a theme of consequence and personal responsibility that may relate to our target proverb.\n4.

This phrase warns about risk management and preparedness - if you have limited resources, you should be cautious.\n3. It suggests consequences can last longer than the initial action (getting wet in rain means having no dry clothes afterward).\n4. This connects to our target proverb about how consequences of bad events can extend far beyond the original incident.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase reinforces that our proverb is about how the effects of misfortune can linger long after the initial event, emphasizing prudence and foresight.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The misfortune of a single day doesn't end quickly.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that the consequences of a single unfortunate event or bad decision can extend far beyond the day it occurs. It warns against impulsive actions by emphasizing that momentary troubles can create lasting effects. In Yoruba culture, which values foresight and wisdom, this proverb serves as a reminder to think about the long-term implications of one's choices. It encourages prudence and careful consideration, recognizing that recovery from setbacks often takes much longer than the events that caused them.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the theme of self-awareness and personal responsibility. Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of preparation and risk management, suggesting that wise people anticipate potential long-term consequences before acting."

It suggests that complaints about outcomes should be contextualized by understanding previous actions or circumstances.\n4.

It suggests that one's identity and behavior should be consistent, and that reputation matters.\n4. There's an implication that what is natural or true to oneself should be embraced rather than forced situations.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase adds the dimension that one should be wary of situations that require excessive explanations or justifications, as they may not be natural or beneficial to us.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"When one must listen to lengthy explanations before receiving an inheritance, know that such an inheritance is not meant for you.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb advises caution when something that should be straightforward (like receiving what is rightfully yours) comes with many conditions or explanations. In Yoruba culture, legitimate inheritances or benefits should come naturally to those entitled to them. If you find yourself in a situation where you must be convinced or persuaded with stories before receiving something, it suggests that it may not rightfully belong to you or might come with hidden problems. It teaches discernment and warns against being lured by enticing opportunities that require excessive justification, as they may not align with your true path or best interests.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase reinforces the importance of knowing background information before making judgments, while the second phrase emphasizes staying true to one's natural position and dignity rather than forcing oneself into unsuitable situations.\n\nFinal Answer: This Yoruba proverb warns that when you must listen to elaborate stories or explanations before receiving an inheritance or benefit, it's a sign that such benefit isn't truly meant for you. It teaches discernment about opportunities that require excessive justification, suggesting that what legitimately belongs to you shouldn't need elaborate convincing. In Yoruba wisdom, this reflects the cultural value of natural alignment - what is truly yours will come without complicated prerequisites or conditions."

When a leader or person in power is behaving badly or irrationally, direct confrontation may be unwise. Instead, one should address the situation by dealing with their subordinates or the systems that support them. The proverb uses the metaphor of house architecture - rather than confronting the wild-acting household head directly, one works through structural elements (the rafters) to influence those who follow him. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of respecting hierarchical structures while still finding effective ways to resolve problems.\n\n- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the idea that perceived limitations can be overcome with proper approach and strategy. Similar Phrase 2 highlights the importance of self-awareness and indirect approaches when navigating relationships across different levels of authority.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"B\u00ed ba\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300-\u1eb9\u0301 b\u00e1 \u0144t\u00e0k\u00ect\u00ec, \u00f2r\u00f3gi l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e1 \u1eb9m\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300\" means \"If the head of the household is behaving wildly, we deal with his followers through the roof beams.\" It teaches that when confronted with irrational or difficult authority figures, the wise approach is not direct confrontation but rather addressing the issue through their supporters or the structures that uphold their authority. This reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on diplomatic problem-solving within hierarchical social structures."

This suggests appearances can be deceiving, and one should pay attention to who actually accomplishes tasks rather than who appears more capable.\n3. The phrase establishes a contrast between two entities (crab and forest) that relates to the contrast in our proverb between \"af\u00ednj\u00fa\" (elegant/fashionable person) and \"\u1ecd\u0300b\u00fan\" (dirty/filthy person).\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests a theme of appearances versus reality, and that one should not judge capabilities based solely on outward appearance.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The elegant/fashionable person enters the market walking majestically, the dirty/filthy person enters the market walking slowly/carefully; it is the dirty person who carries the elegant person's load home.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A gb\u00e9 g\u00e0\u00e1r\u00ec \u1ecdm\u1ecd ewur\u1eb9 \u0144roj\u00fa; k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63e \u1eb9r\u00f9 \u00e0g\u00f9nt\u00e0n\" translates to \"We carry cassava flour and the kid goat is complaining; it is not a sheep's load.\" This suggests someone complaining about a burden that isn't theirs to bear.\n2. The phrase highlights the idea of misplaced complaints or concerns, particularly when someone who isn't doing the actual work is expressing dissatisfaction.\n3. This connects to our proverb by emphasizing the contrast between those who show off (the elegant person) versus those who actually do the work (the dirty person).\n\nInterim Insight: This reinforces the theme that actions and actual contributions matter more than appearances or status. The one who appears less impressive may be the one doing the actual work.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The elegant person enters the market walking majestically, while the dirty person enters the market walking slowly and carefully; yet it is the dirty person who ends up carrying the elegant person's load home.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that appearances can be deceiving. It contrasts the showy, elegant person who displays themselves proudly in public with the humble, perhaps less attractive person who moves more carefully. Despite the elegant person's impressive appearance, it is the unassuming \"dirty\" person who actually does the work and carries the burden. The proverb warns against judging people's worth or capabilities based on their outward appearance or how they present themselves. In Yoruba culture, this reflects values of humility and the importance of actual contribution rather than mere showmanship. It may also critique social hierarchies where those of higher status often rely on the labor of those with lower status.\n\n- References: The proverb connects to Similar Phrase 1 by highlighting the contrast between appearances and reality, and to Similar Phrase 2 by emphasizing that actual work and contribution matter more than status or appearance.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa w\u1ecd \u1ecdj\u00e0 \u00f3 r\u00ecn gb\u1eb9nd\u1eb9\u0301k\u1eb9 \u1ecd\u0300b\u00fan w\u1ecd \u1ecdj\u00e0 \u00f3 r\u00ecn \u1e63\u00f9\u1eb9\u0300\u1e63\u00f9\u1eb9\u0300; \u1ecd\u0300b\u00f9n n\u00ed \u00f3 ru \u1eb9r\u00f9 af\u00ednj\u00fa rel\u00e9\" means \"The elegant person enters the market walking majestically, while the dirty person enters the market walking slowly; yet it is the dirty person who carries the elegant person's load home.\" This Yoruba wisdom teaches that those who make the greatest show of themselves aren't necessarily those who do the actual work. It encourages looking beyond appearances to value people for their real contributions"

This phrase highlights the tortoise's notorious unhurried pace and indeterminate timing in Yoruba folklore.\n3. Both proverbs seem to involve journeys with uncertain outcomes or returns.\n4. The tortoise saying he'll arrive \"when he gets there\" suggests noncommittal responses that avoid making concrete promises.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the proverb may be about undertaking journeys with uncertain returns or making promises without fulfillment.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Cockroach and ant set out on a journey, they said they were going to catch a flying chicken, we saw them depart but never saw them return.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

This phrase speaks to impossibility - the intestines of a bush rat are too small for multiple elders to share meaningfully.\n3. Both proverbs deal with impractical endeavors or unrealistic expectations.\n4. The notion of collective action toward an impossible goal connects with the original proverb about insects trying to catch a flying chicken.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces the theme of attempting something fundamentally impossible or beyond one's capabilities, which helps explain why the insects in our proverb never returned.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Cockroach and ant set out on a journey, claiming they were going to catch a flying chicken; we saw them depart but never saw them return.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the folly of undertaking impossible tasks or making grandiose claims beyond one's capabilities. The cockroach and ant represent individuals making unrealistic boasts (catching a flying chicken would be impossible for such small insects). The proverb warns against embarking on journeys or projects with unrealistic goals, as failure is inevitable. It teaches the importance of knowing one's limitations and being practical in one's ambitions. The proverb can be used to caution against empty boasting or undertaking ventures doomed to fail due to their inherent impossibility.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase about the tortoise going to a party highlights the theme of uncertain journeys, while the second phrase about elders eating bush rat intestines reinforces the concept of attempting something fundamentally impossible."

This provides important context about pigs in Yoruba culture - they're seen as animals that wallow in filth yet remain unaware of how others perceive them.\n3. The imagery suggests self-deception or lack of self-awareness - the pig thinks it's doing something admirable when others see it as dirty or inappropriate.\n4. Both phrases involve \"\u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301d\u1eb9\u0300\" (pig), suggesting our main proverb also deals with misperception or lack of awareness.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase indicates that our proverb likely refers to someone doing something inappropriate or lacking proper judgment while being unaware of their limitation.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.\n\nTranslation: \"The pig does not know birds.\" / \"The pig is not familiar with birds.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00f3 \u00e8l\u00e9 \u1e63\u1eb9\u0300\u1e63\u1ecd\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00f3 \u00e8l\u00e9 \u1e63\u1eb9\u0300\u1e63\u1ecd\u0301\" translates to \"One does not gather pigeons as decorations/ornaments.\"\n2. This proverb suggests that things should be used according to their proper nature or purpose - pigeons aren't decorative objects.\n3. There's a theme of proper categorization and understanding the natural order of things.\n4. This connects to our main proverb by reinforcing the idea of knowing one's place, limitations, or proper domain of knowledge.\n5. Both proverbs emphasize respecting natural boundaries and limitations.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase strengthens the interpretation that the original proverb is about staying within one's realm of knowledge or competence and not presuming expertise in areas where one has no experience.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The pig does not know birds.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against speaking or acting with authority on matters outside one's experience or competence. Just as a pig, a ground-dwelling animal, has no understanding of birds and their ways, people should not presume to have knowledge in areas where they lack expertise. The proverb cautions against overconfidence and encourages humility about the limits of one's knowledge. It's often used to criticize those who speak authoritatively on subjects they know nothing about.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 adds the dimension of self-deception (the pig thinks it's beautifying itself when wallowing in mud), while Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the theme of respecting natural categories and limitations.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301d\u1eb9\u0300 \u00f2 m\u1eb9\u0300y\u1eb9\" literally means \"The pig does not know birds.\" It teaches that one should not claim expertise in matters beyond their experience or understanding. Just as pigs, being land animals, have no real understanding of birds and their flight, people should recognize the limits of their knowledge and not speak authoritatively on unfamiliar subjects. This proverb promotes intellectual humility and self-awareness, cautioning against the folly of presuming knowledge where one has none."

Both phrases involve similar imagery: \"\u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n\" (rope/vine), \"\u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9\" (palm tree), and \"erin\" (elephant).\n2. The first phrase suggests that a rope as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant from proceeding.\n3. Both phrases contain the parallel structure where the rope/chain that is supposed to restrain the elephant ends up going along with the elephant.\n4. This suggests a power dynamic - the elephant (representing great strength) cannot be restrained by something relatively insignificant.\n\nInterim Insight: This appears to be a Yoruba proverb about the futility of weak restraints against powerful forces. The image of a rope or chain that ends up going along with the elephant rather than restraining it creates a powerful visual metaphor.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A chain as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant; the rope that says the elephant should not climb the \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n tree, both the rope and the elephant are going together.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A \u00f2 m\u1ecd ohun t\u00ed D\u00e1r\u00f2-\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f3 t\u00f3 w\u00ed p\u00e9 ol\u00e8-\u00e9 k\u00f3 \u00f2un.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second phrase translates roughly to \"We don't know what Daro had before claiming he was robbed.\"\n2. This introduces a skeptical perspective about claims made without evidence.\n3. This adds an additional layer to our proverb: not only is the restraint ineffective, but the attempt to control the situation leads to a different outcome than intended.\n4. Both phrases deal with situations where expected control or authority fails.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the theme of powerlessness in the face of greater forces, and suggests that claims of control or authority should be viewed skeptically when actual power is lacking.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A chain as tall as a palm tree cannot stop an elephant; the rope that forbids the elephant from climbing the \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n tree ends up going along with the elephant.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the futility of weak constraints against powerful forces. In Yoruba culture, the elephant symbolizes tremendous strength and unstoppable force. The proverb teaches that attempting to control something or someone with insufficient means is not only futile but may result in the would-be controller being carried along by the force they sought to restrain. It warns against overestimating one's authority or influence and serves as a reminder that real power cannot be contained by symbolic or inadequate restraints. The proverb might be applied to situations where institutional rules, social conventions, or individual commands lack the genuine authority or power needed to be effective.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the imagery of the ineffective restraint, while Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of skepticism toward claims of control or authority without sufficient backing.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8\u0300w\u1ecd\u0300n t\u00f3 t\u00f3 \u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9 \u00f2 t\u00f3-\u00f3 d\u00e1 erin d\u00far\u00f3; \u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00ed erin m\u00e1 r\u00f2k\u00e8 \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n, t\u00f2un terin n\u00ed \u0144l\u1ecd\" translates to \"A chain as tall as a palm tree cannot"

This similar phrase talks about how the Okoro tree is treated with respect and called a kola nut tree, and only the kola nuts that grow on it are sweet/valuable.\n2. It suggests a relationship between identity/designation and consequence - something is valued for what it produces, not just what it's called.\n3. This relates to our proverb about the lamp extinguisher by suggesting consequences come from actions, not declarations.\n\nInterim Insight: Both proverbs deal with natural consequences that follow from actions rather than intentions or declarations.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The wind that claims it will extinguish the lamp will burn itself.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eb8y\u1eb9 t\u00f3 fi ara w\u00e9 ig\u00fan, \u1eb9\u0300h\u00ecn \u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144s\u00f9n.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase states that \"a bird that compares itself to a vulture sleeps behind a chicken coop\" - meaning a creature that overestimates its abilities or status will find itself in a humble position.\n2. It warns against overconfidence and pretending to be something you're not, as reality will eventually assert itself.\n3. This connects to our proverb about the wind and lamp - both warn about overestimating one's power and the natural consequences that follow.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverbs share a theme of natural justice - those who overestimate their abilities or make boastful claims will face consequences aligned with their true nature, not their pretensions.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The wind that boasts it will extinguish the lamp will only burn itself.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against empty boasting and overestimating one's abilities. Just as wind might intend to blow out a lamp but instead gets burned by coming too close to the flame, people who make grand claims beyond their capabilities often harm themselves in the process. The proverb teaches humility and self-awareness, encouraging people to recognize their limitations rather than making boastful claims that may lead to their own downfall. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the value placed on humility (\u00ecw\u00e0 p\u1eb9\u0300l\u1eb9\u0301) and the natural justice that follows when one acts contrary to their true nature or capacity.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reminds us that true value comes from what we produce, not what we claim to be. Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the lesson about false pretenses leading to humbling consequences.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0f\u00f2pin\u00e1 t\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 pa f\u00ect\u00edl\u00e0, ara \u1eb9\u0300 ni y\u00f3 pa\" translates to \"The wind that boasts it will extinguish the lamp will only burn itself.\" This proverb warns against empty boasting and overconfidence. In Yoruba wisdom, it teaches that those who overestimate their abilities and make grand claims often end up harming themselves instead. The natural consequence of the wind's interaction with fire parallels how human pretension often leads to self-inflicted damage. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of \u00ecw\u00e0 p\u1eb9\u0300l\u1eb9\u0301 (humility) and belief in natural justice - that the universe has a way of humbling those who fail to recognize their true place and limitations."

The similar phrase \"\u00c0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00e0 l\u1ecd\u0301j\u00e0 k\u00f3r\u00ed \u1ecdm\u1ecd titun w\u1ecd\u0301\" translates to \"An elder should not be present in the marketplace and allow a child's head to be improperly positioned/wrapped.\" This speaks to the responsibility of elders to guide and correct younger ones.\n2. This suggests a theme of dignity, responsibility, and proper social conduct expected from elders in Yoruba society.\n3. The original proverb appears to also address the behavior or situation of an elderly person, suggesting something potentially embarrassing or undignified.\n\nInterim Insight: Both proverbs seem to address expectations of elderly behavior, suggesting there are certain standards elders must maintain to preserve their dignity and respect in society.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Providing a literal English translation of the proverb.\n\nTranslation: \"An elderly person who puts fermented guinea corn into a calabash of banana is embarrassed/ashamed.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: In\u00fa bur\u00fak\u00fa l\u00e0gb\u00e0 \u0144n\u00ed, \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed n\u00ed oj\u00fa bur\u00fak\u00fa.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explaining how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"In\u00fa bur\u00fak\u00fa l\u00e0gb\u00e0 \u0144n\u00ed, \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed n\u00ed oj\u00fa bur\u00fak\u00fa\" translates to \"An elder may have a bad stomach (internal feelings), but an elder should not have a bad face (external expression).\" This speaks to the expectation that elders maintain composure and dignity outwardly regardless of internal struggles.\n2. This reinforces the idea that elders are held to higher standards of public conduct and decorum in Yoruba society.\n3. The original proverb about mixing fermented guinea corn with banana suggests an inappropriate or foolish action that brings shame to an elder, violating these standards of dignified behavior.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb appears to be cautioning against actions that bring public shame to elders, reinforcing the cultural expectation that age comes with responsibility to maintain dignity and avoid embarrassing situations.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"An elderly person who mixes fermented guinea corn into a calabash of bananas feels ashamed.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb speaks to the expectations placed on elders in Yoruba society. It uses the imagery of inappropriately mixing foods (which would be considered foolish or wasteful) to illustrate how elders should avoid undignified or inappropriate behaviors that would bring them shame. In Yoruba culture, elders are expected to be repositories of wisdom and models of proper conduct. When they engage in behaviors unbefitting their status, it not only diminishes their personal dignity but also undermines their standing in the community. The proverb serves as a reminder that age comes with responsibility and certain standards of behavior must be maintained to preserve one's honor and respect.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase emphasizes elders' responsibility to guide younger generations, while the second highlights the expectation that elders maintain dignified composure regardless of circumstances. Together, they frame the cultural context in which improper behavior by elders is seen as particularly shameful."

This similar phrase translates roughly to \"My child's name is \u1ecc\u0300g\u00e0-\u01f9-g\u00e0, stop calling my child \u00d2g\u00f2-\u01f9-g\u00f2! Which one is the good name there?\" This shows concern about proper naming or identity.\n2. It demonstrates how Yoruba people place importance on proper names and titles - calling someone by an incorrect name or title is considered disrespectful.\n3. There's a play on similar-sounding names, suggesting confusion or deliberate misrepresentation.\n\nInterim Insight: This provides context that the main proverb likely deals with issues of identity, titles, or naming - and possibly how people react to labels given to them.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"They call you the child of an elephant who cannot trumpet; are you the one who even swallows it?\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0j\u00e0n\u00e0k\u00fa \u00f2 tu l\u00f3j\u00fa al\u00e1j\u00e1; o-n\u00edgba-aj\u00e1 \u00f2 gb\u1ecdd\u1ecd\u0300 t\u1ecd\u0301pa erin.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase translates roughly to \"An elephant is not insignificant in the eyes of a dog owner; the owner of two hundred dogs must not follow an elephant's tracks.\" This proverb uses elephant imagery to depict power dynamics.\n2. In Yoruba culture, elephants (erin/\u00e0j\u00e0n\u00e0k\u00fa) symbolize great power, size, and significance.\n3. The inability to trumpet (in the main proverb) refers to not living up to one's expected abilities or family legacy.\n\nInterim Insight: The elephant symbolism clarifies that the main proverb is about someone who fails to demonstrate expected abilities based on their prestigious lineage or position, yet paradoxically takes offense at this observation.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"They call you the offspring of an elephant that cannot trumpet; are you the one who even swallows the trumpet?\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes someone who fails to live up to their family reputation or expected abilities (like an elephant's child who cannot trumpet), yet becomes offended when this shortcoming is pointed out. It addresses the irony of someone taking offense at a truth about their inadequacy. In Yoruba culture, this proverb teaches that one should acknowledge one's limitations rather than become defensive when they are mentioned. It's often used when someone reacts angrily to criticism that accurately points out their failure to meet expectations based on their background or position.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase demonstrates the importance of proper naming and identity in Yoruba culture, while the second phrase establishes the elephant as a symbol of power and significance, making the inability to trumpet (a natural elephant ability) more meaningful as a metaphor for failing to live up to one's heritage.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb criticizes someone who gets offended when their failure to live up to their family legacy or position is pointed out, similar to an elephant's child who cannot trumpet yet becomes angry when this inadequacy is mentioned."

This relates to the main proverb through the concept of \"\u1eb9gb\u1eb9\u0301\" (peers/group/equals) appearing in both, suggesting natural affinity and association between similar entities\n3. The similar phrase implies that context can affect recognition of peers, while our main proverb seems to focus on deliberate association\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase helps establish that the main proverb likely deals with social associations and how people naturally seek out those of similar standing.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The wealthy person walks with the prosperous; peers play with peers.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Aaka \u00f2 gb\u00e9 \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n; igb\u00f3 n\u00ed \u0144gb\u00e9\" translates to \"The viper doesn't live in the savanna; it lives in the forest\" - indicating natural habitats and appropriate environments\n2. This phrase reinforces the idea that things/beings have their natural places and associations\n3. It adds the dimension that there's a natural order to relationships and associations - just as certain animals belong in certain habitats, certain people naturally associate with others like themselves\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase strengthens the interpretation that the main proverb speaks to natural social ordering and appropriate associations based on similarity or status.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The wealthy person walks with the prosperous; peers play with peers.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes that people naturally associate with those of similar status, wealth, or circumstances. It reflects the Yoruba cultural understanding of social stratification and natural affinities. The proverb serves both as an observation of social dynamics and a cautionary wisdom about knowing one's place in society. Just as creatures have their natural habitats and companions, humans tend to form relationships with those who share similar life experiences, resources, and status. This isn't necessarily presented as negative, but rather as a natural social principle to be acknowledged.\n- References: The lizard not recognizing its peers in water speaks to natural grouping, while the viper living in the forest not the savanna reinforces that entities have their natural associations and environments.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"Ol\u00f3w\u00f3 n\u00ed \u1e3fb\u00e1 \u1ecdl\u1ecd\u0301r\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd\u0301 r\u00ecn; \u1eb9gb\u1eb9\u0301 n\u00ed \u1e3fb\u00e1 \u1eb9gb\u1eb9\u0301 \u1e63er\u00e9\" translates to \"The wealthy person walks with the prosperous; peers play with peers.\" In Yoruba culture, this expresses the natural tendency for people to associate with others of similar social standing, wealth, or circumstances. Like the viper that belongs in the forest, not the savanna, people gravitate toward environments and relationships that match their status and identity. The proverb acknowledges social stratification as a natural phenomenon while suggesting we should understand where we belong in the social fabric."

This speaks to the limitations of self-service and the importance of recognizing one's position and limitations, even when skilled or powerful.\n3. It suggests that everyone has roles they cannot fulfill for themselves, indicating a social order where interdependence is necessary.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's limitations and proper place in the social order, which appears to relate to the theme of self-awareness in our target proverb.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Let the slave know himself as a slave; let the pawn know himself as a pawn; let the person of good character know himself as a servant of God the king.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

This phrase suggests that recognizing one's limitations and worth is a sign of wisdom and proper self-understanding.\n3. It reinforces the idea that even those in positions of authority (masters/owners) must understand their own boundaries and limitations.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase adds the dimension that self-awareness applies to everyone regardless of social status, and that understanding one's position is a form of wisdom, not just submission.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"Let the slave recognize their position as a slave; let the indentured servant recognize their position as such; let the person of good character recognize themselves as a servant of God the king.\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb speaks to the importance of self-awareness and acceptance of one's position in the social and cosmic order. In traditional Yoruba society, understanding one's place was crucial for social harmony. However, the proverb moves beyond mere social hierarchy to make a profound spiritual point: regardless of social status, everyone (even those of high moral standing - \u1ecdm\u1ecdl\u00faw\u00e0b\u00ed) ultimately serves God. This creates a universal humility that transcends earthly status. The proverb doesn't necessarily endorse slavery or servitude as institutions, but uses these social categories to illustrate that self-knowledge and understanding one's relationship to divine authority brings wisdom and proper conduct. For the Yoruba, recognizing one's position in relation to others and to God represents spiritual maturity and social responsibility.\n\n- **References:** Both similar phrases reinforce the core message that self-awareness of one's limitations and proper place is essential for all individuals regardless of status, and that even those with power or virtue must recognize a higher authority."

This relates to traditional Yoruba contexts where specialists (like tailors) have expertise that should be respected. The recipient shouldn't try to overstep their position by acting more knowledgeable than the specialist.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with respecting the expertise of specialists or professionals and not claiming to know more than them, particularly in ritual or professional contexts.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One should not be wiser than the person who will cast If\u00e1 divination for them.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eb8ni t\u00ed a l\u00e8 gb\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed daw\u1ecd\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eb8ni t\u00ed a l\u00e8 gb\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed daw\u1ecd\u0301\" translates to \"The person who is being carried shouldn't stretch out their hands.\" This refers to someone who is being helped (carried) shouldn't try to do things themselves or interfere with the helper's method.\n2. This reinforces the message about hierarchies of expertise and the appropriate behavior when receiving help or service from someone with specialized knowledge.\n\nInterim Insight: Both similar phrases emphasize the importance of respecting expertise and not interfering when someone is providing you with a specialized service, whether it's divination, tailoring, or physical assistance.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One should not claim to be wiser than the person performing If\u00e1 divination for them.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb addresses the relationship between a diviner (babalawo) and their client. In Yoruba culture, If\u00e1 divination is a complex spiritual system requiring years of training and deep knowledge. The proverb cautions against arrogance when consulting experts, particularly spiritual ones. It reminds us to respect specialized knowledge and not presume to know more than those whose expertise we seek. This extends beyond divination to any professional-client relationship where specialized knowledge is involved. The wisdom emphasizes humility when seeking guidance and acknowledging the boundaries between the roles of service provider and recipient.\n\n- References: The proverb's meaning is illuminated by Similar Phrase 1 (about not dictating terms to a tailor) and Similar Phrase 2 (about not interfering when being carried), both reinforcing the cultural value of respecting expertise and maintaining appropriate roles in service relationships.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed gb\u1ecd\u0301n ju \u1eb9ni t\u00ed a m\u00e1a d\u00cdf\u00e1 f\u00fan\" means \"One should not claim to be wiser than the person performing If\u00e1 divination for them.\" It teaches the importance of respecting experts in their domain and maintaining humility when seeking specialized services. In Yoruba culture, this especially applies to spiritual consultations with If\u00e1 diviners (babalawos), but extends to all professional relationships where specialized knowledge is involved. The proverb warns against the arrogance of thinking you know more than the expert whose help you're seeking."

The similar phrase speaks about how one's condition follows them regardless of location - poverty isn't tied to geography but to circumstance.\n2. It suggests that one's status determines how they're treated in society - a poor person will be served water in whatever container is available, indicating minimal respect.\n\nInterim Insight: This suggests our proverb may also deal with how one's circumstances or status follows them regardless of location, and how people are treated based on their perceived standing in society.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin?

This phrase emphasizes how one's associations and identity determine their experiences - those who live in community have certain advantages, while those who are \"broken\" (like a broken egg) cannot remain among the whole.\n2. It suggests a natural order where similar things group together and dissimilar things are separated.\n\nInterim Insight: Combined with our proverb, this suggests that Amodu's situation in Ilorin and the goat's continuing behavior reflect a natural consistency - things continue as they are despite changes in location or attempts to alter circumstances.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat is still eating like that.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb speaks to the persistence of nature and character regardless of location or intervention. Just as Amodu's situation in Ilorin hasn't changed, the goat continues its natural behavior of eating in its characteristic way. The proverb teaches that fundamental nature is difficult to change - people and animals tend to maintain their essential character and habits regardless of attempts to change them or changes in their environment. It can be used to comment on the futility of trying to change someone's inherent nature or to observe that despite new circumstances, old patterns persist.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase reinforces how circumstances follow a person regardless of location, while the second phrase emphasizes how natural order tends to maintain itself, with each thing remaining true to its nature.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"K\u00ed ni w\u1ecd\u0301n ti \u0144\u1e63e \u00c0m\u1ecd\u0301d\u00f9 n\u00cdl\u1ecdrin? Ew\u00far\u1eb9\u0301 \u0144j\u1eb9\u0301 b\u1eb9\u0301\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat is still eating like that.\" It conveys that despite changes in location or circumstances, one's essential nature remains unchanged. Just as a goat continues to eat in its characteristic way regardless of what's happening elsewhere, people tend to maintain their fundamental character despite external changes or interventions.

This suggests something about expertise, roles, and responsibilities - a true expert knows their domain and doesn't need to ask basic questions about completed tasks.\n3. This might suggest our target proverb also deals with authenticity, competence, or the nature of expertise.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the proverb may be about recognizing true expertise or natural abilities versus imitation or pretense.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One creates/makes a dove that goes 'b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300'\" or \"We create a dove that sounds 'b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300'\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Af\u00ednj\u00fau \u00c0\u00e0r\u00e9; \u00f3 fi \u00e0k\u00eds\u00e0 d\u00ed or\u00f9b\u00e0; \u00f3 \u0144w\u00e1 \u1eb9niire-\u00e9 b\u00e1 s\u00fa epo\" translates roughly to \"The fastidious person of Aare; who wraps rags as head-tie; who seeks someone to prepare palm oil soup with.\"\n2. This phrase is about pretentiousness or false appearances - someone who tries to appear wealthy or sophisticated while lacking basic necessities.\n3. Combined with our initial proverb, this suggests the theme is about inauthenticity or imitation - attempting to create something that isn't genuine.\n\nInterim Insight: Both similar phrases point to a theme of false pretenses or imitation versus authenticity. The dove making an unnatural sound \"b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" represents something artificial trying to pass as genuine.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One creates a dove that sounds 'b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300'\" (instead of the natural cooing sound)\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb critiques artificial imitation or pretense. A dove naturally has a specific cooing sound, and one that makes an unnatural sound like \"b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" is clearly fake or manufactured. It's used to describe situations where someone is attempting to pass off something inauthentic as genuine, or someone pretending to be what they are not. Like the babalawo who should know his craft without asking basic questions, or the pretentious person wearing rags while seeking luxury, the proverb warns against artificiality and celebrates authenticity.\n- References: The first similar phrase about the babalawo highlights expertise and authenticity, while the second phrase about the pretentious person emphasizes the futility of false appearances.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"A-d\u00e1-m\u00e1-l\u00e8-\u1e63e \u00e0d\u00e0b\u00e0 t\u00ed \u0144d\u00fan b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"One creates a dove that makes the sound 'b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300'.\" In Yoruba cultural context, this proverb points to inauthenticity or poor imitation. A genuine dove makes its natural cooing sound, so one that makes the strange sound \"b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" is obviously artificial. This proverb is used to describe situations where people pretend to be what they're not or when something counterfeit is trying to pass as authentic. It teaches the value of genuineness and warns against deception through poor imitation."

Both phrases use the structure \"k\u00ec \u00ed\" which indicates something that should not be done - a prohibition or improper action in Yoruba cultural context.\n3. The similar phrase emphasizes consciousness and intentionality in actions, suggesting our target proverb may also speak to deliberate action and responsibility.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with proper conduct, accountability, or the relationship between action and consequence.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.\nTranslation: \"One who beats the d\u00f9nd\u00fan drum cannot deny [playing] the music.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63er\u00e9e k\u00ed-l\u00f3-b\u00e1-y\u00ec\u00ed-w\u00e1?\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63er\u00e9e k\u00ed-l\u00f3-b\u00e1-y\u00ec\u00ed-w\u00e1?\" translates to \"An elder doesn't play the game of 'what brought this about?'\" meaning elders should take responsibility rather than feigning ignorance about consequences.\n2. This reinforces the theme of accountability present in our target proverb - just as elders should own their actions, so too should drummers acknowledge the music they create.\n3. The d\u00f9nd\u00fan is a talking drum in Yoruba culture that \"speaks\" the Yoruba tonal language, so the drummer has direct agency and responsibility for the \"words\" produced.\n\nInterim Insight: The cultural significance of the d\u00f9nd\u00fan as a communication tool adds depth to the proverb - it's not just about music but about communication, expression, and taking ownership of one's words and actions.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One who beats the d\u00f9nd\u00fan drum cannot deny [responsibility for] the music [it produces].\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes personal accountability for one's actions and their consequences. In Yoruba culture, the d\u00f9nd\u00fan is not merely a musical instrument but a communication tool that \"speaks\" through its tones. The drummer deliberately creates specific sounds, so claiming no responsibility for what emerges would be absurd. The proverb teaches that we must own the consequences of our deliberate actions, just as a drummer must acknowledge the music they create. It applies broadly to situations where people attempt to distance themselves from the natural outcomes of their own actions.\n- References: The accountability theme in \"A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00e1 \u1e63\u00ecw\u00ed; a k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00f2 s\u00f9n-\u00f9n k\u00e1 d\u00e1r\u00e0n\" and the elder's responsibility in \"\u00c0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63er\u00e9e k\u00ed-l\u00f3-b\u00e1-y\u00ec\u00ed-w\u00e1?\" both reinforce the cultural value of owning one's actions and their consequences.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"A-lu-d\u00f9nd\u00fan k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1rin\" translates to \"One who beats the d\u00f9nd\u00fan drum cannot deny responsibility for the music it produces.\" It teaches that we must take responsibility for our actions and their consequences. In Yoruba culture, where the talking drum literally \"speaks\" through the drummer's skill, this imagery powerfully conveys that we cannot separate ourselves from what we deliberately create or cause. This wisdom applies whenever someone tries to disown the predictable outcomes of their own choices."

This similar phrase suggests that someone with limited resources (only one cloth) cannot afford to take risks (playing in the rain) that could damage their only possession.\n3. The concept emphasizes prudence when one has limited resources - the person must be careful with their sole possession.\n4. This helps understand the original proverb's likely focus on resource management and caution.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase indicates that the original proverb likely addresses prudent behavior when one has limited resources, specifically related to clothing or material possessions.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.\n\nTranslation: \"A person with only one cloth does not spread it to dry for others.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A k\u00ec \u00ed pe \u00ecy\u00e0w\u00f3 k\u00f3 kan al\u00e1r\u1eb9n\u00e0.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A k\u00ec \u00ed pe \u00ecy\u00e0w\u00f3 k\u00f3 kan al\u00e1r\u1eb9n\u00e0\" translates roughly to \"One doesn't call a bride to affect the go-between/intermediary.\"\n2. This proverb suggests that people should respect established protocols and hierarchies - the bride shouldn't bypass or interfere with the intermediary's role.\n3. It speaks to the importance of respecting boundaries and roles within Yoruba cultural contexts.\n4. This adds a dimension of social boundaries and proper conduct to the interpretation of our original proverb.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase suggests that the original proverb may also relate to proper social conduct, responsibilities, and knowing one's limitations within community structures.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"A person with only one cloth doesn't lend it out to others to dry.\"\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb teaches prudence and self-preservation when one has limited resources. Just as a person with only one garment cannot afford to lend it to others (as they would have nothing to wear), people should be careful about depleting their limited resources by trying to help others. It emphasizes the importance of securing one's own stability before extending help to others. In Yoruba culture, where community support is valued but personal responsibility is essential, this proverb reminds individuals to balance generosity with self-preservation. It acknowledges that one must first take care of their own basic needs before being in a position to assist others.\n- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 (\"A person with only one cloth doesn't play in the rain\") reinforces the message of protecting limited resources, while Similar Phrase 2 relates to understanding proper social boundaries and responsibilities.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"Al\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd-kan k\u00ec \u00ed n\u00e1 \u00e0n\u00e1r\u1eb9\" translates to \"A person with only one cloth doesn't lend it out to others to dry.\" It teaches that those with limited resources must be prudent about how they use or share them.

This phrase emphasizes respect for elders and suggests that preserving an elder's dignity is better than seeing them dishonored or harmed.\n3. Both phrases use the comparative structure \"\u00f3 s\u00e0n ju... l\u1ecd\" (it is better than...), suggesting the original proverb also compares two states involving elders.\n4. Both phrases appear to address the proper treatment and dignity of elders in Yoruba culture.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely contrasts two possible conditions for elders, with one being preferable to the other from a cultural perspective of dignity and respect.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The day an elder dies is better than the day an elder is disgraced/humiliated.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

This phrase highlights the cultural practices of showing respect to elders and authority figures even in everyday settings like marketplaces.\n3. It reinforces the importance of maintaining social hierarchies and proper protocols of respect in Yoruba society.\n4. The phrase demonstrates how respect for elders is woven into daily activities and social interactions.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase adds context about how elders are positioned in Yoruba society - they are to be acknowledged with respect in all settings. This helps us understand why disgrace would be considered worse than death in our original proverb.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It is better for an elder to die than to be disgraced.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb reflects the profound Yoruba cultural value placed on dignity, honor, and respect, particularly for elders. In Yoruba culture, elders are repositories of wisdom, guardians of tradition, and embodiments of ancestral connection. The proverb suggests that death, which is a natural end to life, is preferable to living with shame or disgrace that destroys one's dignity and social standing. This sentiment underscores how seriously Yoruba culture takes matters of honor and shame - death itself is considered less severe than the social death that comes with disgrace. The proverb teaches that preserving one's integrity and dignity until death is among the highest virtues.\n- References: The first similar phrase reinforces the importance of respecting elders' dignity above all else. The second similar phrase demonstrates how respect for elders is deeply embedded in daily Yoruba social interactions."

This phrase establishes that birds have a limitation - they cannot access water that is inside a coconut.\n3. The imagery suggests a natural limitation based on physical capability or design.\n4. There's a contrast between the bird's freedom of movement (flying/perching) and its inability to access something contained within a closed space.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb uses the bird and coconut as symbols to express natural limitations. The bird represents a being with certain capabilities (flight) but also inherent limitations (inability to access enclosed water).\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.\n\nTranslation: \"A bird cannot see the water inside a coconut to drink it.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0p\u00e1r\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1 ni in\u00e1 \u0144d\u00e1; in\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u00e8 r\u00ed omi gb\u00e9\u1e63e.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

This introduces another natural element (fire) that has both power (creating flames) and limitation (inability to extinguish itself).\n3. Both proverbs follow a similar structure: an entity with certain abilities cannot perceive or access something that lies outside its natural capacity.\n4. The concept of inherent limitations despite having other strengths is reinforced.\n\nInterim Insight: These proverbs establish a Yoruba philosophical concept about natural limitations - even powerful or capable entities have boundaries they cannot cross due to their inherent nature.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A bird cannot see the water inside a coconut to drink it.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the natural limitations that all beings have, regardless of their strengths in other areas. It teaches humility by highlighting that everyone has boundaries defined by their nature or position. The proverb can be applied to human contexts where people might overestimate their abilities or try to access knowledge or resources beyond their reach. It counsels self-awareness about one's limitations and the acceptance of natural boundaries. In Yoruba philosophy, understanding and accepting one's limitations is considered wisdom rather than weakness.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of natural limitations using the same imagery of birds and coconuts. Similar Phrase 2 extends this philosophical concept to other natural elements (fire), showing this is a broader principle in Yoruba thought about the natural order of capabilities and limitations.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8y\u1eb9 \u00f2 l\u00e8 r\u00ed omi in\u00fa \u00e0gb\u1ecdn b\u00f9 mu\" translates to \"A bird cannot see the water inside a coconut to drink it.\" It teaches that all beings have natural limitations regardless of their other capabilities. In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb encourages self-awareness about one's boundaries and cautions against attempting to reach beyond one's inherent capacity. It reminds us that recognizing and accepting our limitations is part of wisdom, not failure."

This phrase speaks to the continuity of understanding or awareness despite changes in circumstances - even as one ages, they still understand or relate to youthful energy.\n3.

This phrase speaks to knowing when something is finished and when to depart - lingering after your role is complete can bring unexpected consequences.\n3. Both phrases contain \"t\u00e1n\" (completely/finished) and deal with consequences of actions or inaction.\n\nInterim Insight: This reinforces that our proverb warns about overconfidence in knowledge leading to downfall - just as the gravedigger who stays too long risks an unwanted outcome.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It is with 'I know it completely' that Oro carries away a man.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against overconfidence or presumed expertise. Oro is a powerful deity in Yoruba tradition associated with ancestral spirits and sometimes death. The proverb suggests that excessive confidence in one's knowledge (\"I know it completely\") often leads to downfall or destruction. It cautions against arrogance and reminds us that claiming complete knowledge of something dangerous can lead to serious consequences. Just as those who claim to fully understand Oro's mysteries might be the ones carried away by the deity, those who boast of complete mastery often fall victim to their own overconfidence.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase reminds us that awareness should be continuous and humble, while the second similar phrase reinforces the idea that knowing when something is complete (and respecting boundaries) is crucial for safety.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"Mo m\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1n\" lOr\u00f2-\u00f3 fi \u0144gb\u00e9 \u1ecdk\u00f9nrin means \"It is with 'I know it completely' that Oro carries away a man.\" This Yoruba wisdom warns against the dangers of overconfidence. In Yoruba culture, Oro is a powerful ancestral deity associated with mysteries and sometimes death. The proverb teaches that those who boast of complete knowledge or mastery are often the ones who suffer consequences. It's a caution against intellectual arrogance and a reminder that claiming to fully understand dangerous matters can lead to one's downfall. True wisdom includes acknowledging the limits of one's knowledge."

The phrase \"Ibi t\u00ed a fi iy\u1ecd\u0300 s\u00ed l\u00f3 \u0144\u1e63omi s\u00ed\" literally translates to \"The place where we put salt is where water flows to.\"\n2. This Yoruba proverb suggests that resources naturally flow toward areas of investment or priority.\n3. It implies that attention follows our priorities - where we invest our energy is where we'll see results.\n4. This relates to the concept of focused attention and resource allocation in Yoruba cultural wisdom.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests the main proverb likely deals with prioritization, resource allocation, or how attention to one thing might affect another.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"When we are carefully arranging corn, we don't arrange guinea corn at the same time.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: K\u00ed ni el\u00e9w\u00e9-e-gb\u00e9gb\u00e9 \u0144t\u00e0 t\u00ed \u00f3 \u0144s\u1ecd p\u00e9 \u1ecdj\u00e0 \u00f2 t\u00e0?\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase translates roughly to \"What is the seller of gb\u00e9gb\u00e9 leaves selling that makes him/her say the market is not profitable?\"\n2. This proverb questions why someone with a specific role or responsibility would complain about lack of success.\n3. It suggests that focus and specialization are important - one should concentrate on their specific trade rather than complaining about general market conditions.\n4. This adds the dimension of focused effort and specialization to our understanding of the main proverb.\n\nInterim Insight: This reinforces that the main proverb is about the importance of focusing on one task at a time and not dividing attention between multiple efforts simultaneously.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"When we are arranging corn, we don't arrange guinea corn at the same time.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches the wisdom of focused attention and avoiding multitasking. In Yoruba agricultural traditions, different grains require different sorting and processing methods. The proverb advises that one should complete one task before moving to another, rather than attempting to do multiple things simultaneously and doing none well. It emphasizes the importance of prioritization, patience, and methodical work - core values in Yoruba culture. Just as a farmer must give proper attention to each crop in its time, people should focus their energies on one important task at a time to ensure quality results.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces how resources flow to where we focus our attention. Similar Phrase 2 emphasizes the importance of specialization and focused effort in one's responsibilities.\n\nFinal Answer: \"When we are arranging corn, we don't arrange guinea corn at the same time\" - This Yoruba proverb teaches the wisdom of focused attention and completing one task before beginning another. In traditional Yoruba culture, different grains require different handling techniques, making it inefficient to process them simultaneously. The proverb counsels against multitasking, instead advocating for complete attention to one priority before moving to the next. This reflects broader Yoruba values of patience, methodical work, and proper resource allocation."

This phrase highlights irony and contradiction - someone complaining about poor sales while selling something that actually has value.\n3. It points to the theme of failing to recognize or appreciate what is available to you.\n4. There's an element of ingratitude or unreasonable rejection of what's being offered.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with the rejection of something beneficial without good reason, possibly highlighting ingratitude or poor judgment.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Your younger sibling is sewing clothes for you, you say you don't patronize the seller of ekuru (bean cake); who then patronizes the seller of akara (fried bean cake)?\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eb8\u0300gb\u1ecd\u0301n \u1e63\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa \u00f3 so a\u1e63\u1ecd k\u1ecd\u0301; \u00e0b\u00far\u00f2-\u00f3 k\u1eb9\u0301h\u00ecn \u00f3 w\u1eb9\u0300w\u00f9; b\u00ed a \u00f2 m\u1ecd\u0300l\u1eb9, \u1ecd\u0300l\u1eb9 \u00f2 m\u1ecd araa r\u1eb9\u0300?\" translates to \"The elder sibling in front ties cloth; the younger sibling behind wears gown; if we don't recognize laziness, does laziness not recognize itself?\"\n2. This phrase emphasizes family relationships and responsibilities - how elder and younger siblings should behave toward each other.\n3. It suggests that roles and contributions within family structures should be acknowledged and respected.\n4. There's an element of accountability and self-awareness in familial relationships.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase reinforces that our proverb likely addresses familial relationships, specifically the proper acknowledgment of help and support from family members, and the importance of appreciating what relatives do for us.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Your younger sibling is sewing clothes for you, yet you claim you don't patronize the seller of ekuru (bean cake); who then patronizes the seller of akara (fried bean cake)?\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes ingratitude and the failure to appreciate help from close relations. It points out the contradiction of rejecting assistance from someone close to you (your younger sibling) while claiming you don't support certain people. Ekuru and akara are both bean-based foods, with akara generally being more popular than ekuru. The proverb uses this food comparison to highlight the absurdity of the situation - if you won't even accept help from your own family (analogous to not buying from the ekuru seller), then who would you accept help from (who would buy from the akara seller)? In Yoruba culture, family bonds and reciprocal support are highly valued, and this proverb serves as a reminder to appreciate and acknowledge the contributions of family members, especially when they go out of their way to help you.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase highlights the irony of rejecting something of value, while the second reinforces the importance of recognizing and respecting familial roles and contributions."

This establishes a theme of personal character and how it relates to one's life path and dignity.\n3. Both proverbs start with \"B\u00ed\" (if), suggesting conditional reasoning in Yoruba philosophical thinking.\n4. The similar phrase emphasizes how one's reputation and character determine one's legacy, suggesting a link to personal habits and consistency.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely addresses the relationship between personal character/habits and natural consequences, possibly focusing on morning routines as symbolic of one's character.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"If it were not part of a person's nature/habit, who would wake up in the morning and not wash their face?\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

This introduces concepts of shame, responsibility, and how individual actions reflect on one's community.\n3. Both proverbs deal with expected behavior and deviations from norms.\n4. The second similar phrase suggests that when natural expectations aren't met, there are social consequences.\n\nInterim Insight: The main proverb uses face-washing (a universal morning routine) to illustrate how certain behaviors are so natural and expected that only an unusual person would neglect them, suggesting that fundamental habits reveal character.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"If it were not part of a person's nature (or bad habit), who would wake up in the morning and not wash their face?\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb uses the universal act of washing one's face in the morning as a metaphor for basic decency and normal human behavior. It suggests that when someone consistently fails to do what is obviously expected or beneficial, it reveals something fundamental about their character rather than being a simple oversight. In Yoruba culture, personal hygiene is linked to moral cleanliness, and this proverb teaches that habitual neglect of basic responsibilities reflects a character flaw rather than a mere mistake. The proverb can be applied to situations where someone repeatedly fails to meet basic expectations, suggesting their behavior stems from their inherent nature rather than circumstances.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 connects the proverb to how character determines one's path in life, while Similar Phrase 2 enriches the interpretation by highlighting how deviations from expected behavior have social consequences."

This phrase emphasizes naming, identification, and recognition as important cultural values in Yoruba society.\n3. The reference to \"iga ak\u00e0n\" (termite hill) growing steadily relates to how names and titles accumulate and grow in significance over time.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests persistence and growth, which may relate to how names and titles gain respect and recognition in Yoruba culture, hinting that the main proverb likely concerns naming traditions and respect accorded to maternal figures.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"\u0130y\u00e1-a K\u00e1\u00e0\" (Mother of Reading/Counting) is an honorific title; no mother exists in the community of reading/counting who doesn't have a name/title.\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed a k\u00f2 b\u00e1 t\u00f3 \u00ecy\u00e0-\u00e1 k\u1ecd\u0300 t\u00ed \u00e0 \u0144k\u1ecd\u0300 \u1ecd\u0301, \u00e0j\u1eb9k\u00fan \u00ecy\u00e0 l\u00e0 \u0144j\u1eb9.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

Both phrases emphasize the importance of acknowledging sources of knowledge and wisdom, and showing proper respect.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the idea that recognition of teachers/mothers/sources of knowledge is essential, and failing to properly acknowledge them leads to difficulties. This connects to the main proverb's emphasis on naming and honoring maternal or teaching figures.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The title 'Mother of Education' is an honorific; every mother in the realm of education has her own distinct name/title.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of proper recognition and respect for knowledge-givers, particularly maternal figures. In Yoruba culture, names and titles are deeply significant and confer identity and honor. The proverb suggests that those who impart knowledge (symbolized by mothers who teach reading/counting) deserve specific recognition through proper titles. It reflects the Yoruba value system where proper acknowledgment of elders, teachers, and knowledge-bearers is essential. The proverb may be used when advocating for proper attribution, respect for intellectual contributions, or honoring those who educate others.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase about the termite hill suggests steady growth and advancement, similar to how respect and recognition accumulate. The second phrase about learning lessons properly reinforces the importance of acknowledging those who teach us, lest we suffer from ignorance.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0p\u1ecd\u0301nl\u00e9 ni '\u0130y\u00e1-a K\u00e1\u00e0'; \u00ecy\u00e1 kan \u00f2 s\u00ed n\u00ed k\u00e1\u00e0 t\u00ed k\u00f2 l\u00f3r\u00fak\u1ecd\" means that every mother who teaches (reading, counting, or knowledge) deserves proper recognition through a specific name or title. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the deep respect for knowledge-givers and the importance of properly acknowledging their contributions. The proverb teaches us that we should always give proper credit and respect to those who educate us, as names and titles are not merely labels but convey honor and recognition of one's significance in society."

This contrasts with our proverb where a problematic situation (burning soup) causes speech rather than silence.\n3. Together, these proverbs show the range of responses to troubles - some situations silence us, while others demand immediate verbal response.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb indicates that some crises (like burning food) are urgent enough to demand immediate attention and discussion, breaking social protocols around speech.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"When the soup starts burning, it causes conversation.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that urgent problems demand immediate attention and discussion. In Yoruba culture, cooking is an important daily activity, and burning soup represents a domestic crisis that requires immediate intervention. The proverb is used to explain that when serious issues arise, they naturally prompt discussion and action, regardless of normal social conventions. It can be applied to situations where an emergency or crisis forces people to address issues they might otherwise avoid discussing.\n- References: The first similar phrase shows how circumstances affect speech, while the second shows the contrast between situations that silence us versus those that prompt urgent communication.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed in\u00e1 b\u00e1 dun \u1ecdb\u1eb9\u0300, a d\u00e1 \u1ecd\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300 s\u1ecd\" means \"When the soup starts burning, it causes conversation.\" It teaches that urgent problems naturally prompt immediate discussion and action. In Yoruba culture, where cooking is central to daily life, burning food represents a crisis that cannot be ignored. The proverb is often used to explain how emergencies force people to address issues directly, breaking through normal social constraints on speech and communication."

This similar phrase contains key elements from the original proverb, specifically mentioning \"\u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0\" (elder), \"\u00e0\u1e63ej\u00f9\" (excess), and \"\u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0301\" (shame/disgrace).\n2. It suggests that an elder who engages in excessive behavior will end up in shame or disgrace.\n3. The phrase implies a cultural expectation that elders should model restraint and appropriate behavior.\n4. The use of \"w\u1eb9\u0300w\u00f9\" suggests wearing or putting on excess like a garment, showing how one embraces inappropriate behavior.\n\nInterim Insight: This appears to be a cautionary proverb about the consequences of excessive or inappropriate behavior, especially for those who should know better (elders).\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Excess is the father of shame; shame is the end result of excess; an elder who wears the garment of excess will end up in shame.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: Al\u00e1\u1e63ej\u00f9, p\u1eb9\u0300r\u1eb9\u0300 n\u00ed \u0144t\u1eb9\u0301; \u00e0\u1e63\u00e9j\u00f9, baba \u00e0\u1e63et\u1eb9\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second phrase reinforces the relationship between excess (\u00e0\u1e63ej\u00f9) and shame (\u00e0\u1e63et\u1eb9\u0301), explicitly stating that excess is the \"father\" of shame.\n2. \"Al\u00e1\u1e63ej\u00f9, p\u1eb9\u0300r\u1eb9\u0300 n\u00ed \u0144t\u1eb9\u0301\" suggests that one who engages in excess will quickly or eventually be disgraced.\n3. The structure shows a cause-and-effect relationship, emphasizing the inevitable consequences of immoderate behavior.\n4. This phrase lacks the specific reference to elders, suggesting the principle applies universally, though the original proverb emphasizes its application to elders.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb teaches moderation as a cultural value in Yoruba society, with particular emphasis on how shameful it is when respected elders fail to demonstrate this virtue.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Excess is the father of shame; shame follows excess; an elder who indulges in excess will end in disgrace.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the cultural value of moderation (\u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300nt\u00fanw\u1ecd\u0300ns\u00ec) in Yoruba society. It teaches that excessive behavior inevitably leads to shame or disgrace, and this is particularly unbecoming for elders who should exemplify wisdom and self-restraint. In Yoruba culture, elders are expected to model appropriate behavior for younger generations. The proverb uses the metaphor of \"wearing excess like a garment\" to illustrate how people consciously choose immoderate behavior. It serves as both a warning about the consequences of excess and a reminder of the social expectations placed on those of advanced age and presumed wisdom.\n\n- References: Both Similar Phrase 1 \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 t\u00f3 w\u1eb9\u0300w\u00f9 \u00e0\u1e63ej\u00f9, \u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0301 ni y\u00f3 fi r\u00ed\" and Similar Phrase 2 \"Al\u00e1\u1e63ej\u00f9, p\u1eb9\u0300r\u1eb9\u0300 n\u00ed \u0144t\u1eb9\u0301; \u00e0\u1e63\u00e9j\u00f9, baba \u00e0\u1e63et\u1eb9\u0301\" reinforce the central theme that excess leads to shame, with particular emphasis on the expectations of elders in Yoruba society.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0\u1e63ej\u00f9 baba \u00e0\u1e63et\u1eb9\u0301; \u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0301 n\u00ed \u0144gb\u1eb9\u0300h\u00ecn \u00e0\u1e63ej\u00f9; \u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 t\u00f3 w\u1eb9\u0300w\u00f9 \u00e0\u1e63ej"

This speaks to vulnerability and risk management - when you have limited resources, you must be cautious.\n3. The phrase emphasizes consequences of momentary actions that can lead to lasting problems.\n4. It suggests prudence and careful planning when one's resources or options are limited.\n\nInterim Insight: Both phrases seem to address the relationship between a brief action or moment and its enduring consequences.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"It takes only one day to become lame/crippled; it's every day that one suffers the consequences/pain.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eccj\u1ecd\u0301 kan l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e0j\u1eb9\u0301, \u1ecdj\u1ecd\u0301 gbogbo lara \u0144tini.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eccj\u1ecd\u0301 kan l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e0j\u1eb9\u0301, \u1ecdj\u1ecd\u0301 gbogbo lara \u0144tini\" translates to \"It takes only one day to get spoiled/ruined, but one suffers the consequences every day.\"\n2. This is almost identical in meaning to our main proverb, reinforcing its importance in Yoruba thought.\n3. The repetition of this concept across proverbs highlights the cultural emphasis on foresight and caution.\n4. Both stress that momentary mistakes or misfortunes can lead to permanent or long-lasting suffering.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase confirms the main proverb's meaning about the disproportionate relationship between a brief moment of misfortune and its enduring consequences.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It takes only one day to become disabled/injured; but one suffers the pain every day thereafter.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the disparity between the brief moment when misfortune or poor decisions occur and the enduring consequences that follow. It serves as a caution against impulsive actions or carelessness, reminding people that life-changing injuries, mistakes, or misfortunes can happen in an instant, while their effects must be endured indefinitely. The proverb teaches the values of foresight, caution, and thoughtful decision-making in Yoruba culture, where wisdom is highly prized and the interconnection between present actions and future consequences is deeply understood.\n- References: The similar phrases \"Al\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd-kan k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63er\u00e9 \u00f2j\u00f2\" (One with only one cloth doesn't play in the rain) and \"\u1eccj\u1ecd\u0301 kan l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e0j\u1eb9\u0301, \u1ecdj\u1ecd\u0301 gbogbo lara \u0144tini\" (It takes one day to get ruined, but one suffers every day) both reinforce this cultural teaching about caution and the lasting impact of momentary events.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eccj\u1ecd\u0301 kan \u1e63o\u1e63o l\u00e0 \u0144t\u1eb9\u0301; ojooj\u00fam\u1ecd\u0301 loj\u00fa \u0144tini\" translates to \"It takes only one day to become disabled/injured; but one suffers the pain every day thereafter.\" This proverb teaches that momentary actions or accidents can lead to permanent consequences that must be endured indefinitely. It serves as a warning to be cautious and thoughtful, as a single unfortunate incident can result in lasting suffering. This reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on foresight, prudent decision-making, and understanding the relationship between present actions and future outcomes."

The similar structure suggests both phrases involve caution against premature judgment or action without proper consideration.\n3. Both phrases use the \"A k\u00ec \u00ed\" construction, which indicates a prohibition or warning against certain behaviors in Yoruba cultural wisdom.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests our target proverb likely warns against making judgments or decisions without proper consideration or speech.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One does not keep silent and speak incorrectly; one does not look while sleeping and find someone guilty.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00f3rira \u1ecd\u0300f\u1ecd\u0301n-\u1ecd\u0300n k\u00e1 fin\u00e1 b\u1ecd ah\u00e9r\u00e9.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00f3rira \u1ecd\u0300f\u1ecd\u0301n-\u1ecd\u0300n k\u00e1 fin\u00e1 b\u1ecd ah\u00e9r\u00e9\" translates to \"One does not hate the mosquito and set fire to the hut.\" This warns against extreme reactions that cause self-harm.\n2.

The phrase emphasizes the Yoruba cultural value of measured response and thoughtful deliberation.\n\nInterim Insight: This reinforces that our proverb likely concerns the importance of awareness and consciousness before making judgments or taking actions.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One should not remain silent and then speak incorrectly; one should not be half-asleep and find someone guilty.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of full awareness and proper engagement before making judgments or pronouncements. It warns against rendering verdicts without proper attention or understanding. In Yoruba culture, justice and fair judgment are paramount social values, and this proverb teaches that one must be fully conscious, attentive, and engaged before passing judgment or speaking on important matters. It advocates for mindfulness and cautions against the dangers of careless speech or judgment.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase warns against premature judgment, while the second cautions against disproportionate reactions, both reinforcing the proverb's message about the need for careful consideration before action or speech.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00e1 \u1e63\u00ecw\u00ed; a k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00f2 s\u00f9n-\u00f9n k\u00e1 d\u00e1r\u00e0n\" translates to \"One should not remain silent and then speak incorrectly; one should not be half-asleep and find someone guilty.\" It teaches the fundamental importance of being fully present, attentive, and engaged before making important pronouncements or judgments.

Together, they frame our proverb as advice about working competently within one's area of expertise.\n\nFinal Answer: \"Work within your expertise, beautifier of \u1e62\u00e0p\u1ecd\u0301n\" - This Yoruba proverb encourages people to recognize their strengths and limitations, advising them to focus on applying their specific skills effectively rather than overreaching.

Both proverbs feature a pattern where everyone is mourning/crying for someone (B\u00e1nj\u1ecd or Aw\u00fagb\u00f3), but that person isn't crying for themselves.\n3. This suggests a situation where people show concern for someone who doesn't show the same concern for their own situation.\n4. Names like B\u00e1nj\u1ecd and Aw\u00fagb\u00f3 are likely representing any individual in this context, not specific people.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb appears to highlight a disconnect between others' perception of someone's troubles and that person's own perception of their situation.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Everyone is crying for Banjo; but Banjo is not crying for himself.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"M\u00e9l\u00f2\u00f3 l\u00c8j\u00ecgb\u00f2 t\u00ed \u1ecd\u0300kan \u1eb9\u0300 \u0144j\u1eb9\u0301 Ay\u00e9-gbogbo?\" translates roughly to \"How many people are in Ejigbo that one of them is called 'Owner-of-the-whole-world'?\"\n2. This phrase questions someone's self-importance or someone who acts like they own everything or know everything.\n3. When connected to our proverb, it suggests that while others may be concerned about someone's welfare (crying for Banjo), that person may be unconcerned or have a different perspective about their own situation.\n4. It adds the cultural nuance that sometimes what outsiders perceive as problems might not be seen as such by the person experiencing them.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the idea that external perceptions often differ from internal ones, and suggests a critique of those who concern themselves with others' affairs when their perspective may be limited.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Everyone cries for Banjo, but Banjo does not cry for himself.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the discrepancy between how others perceive someone's situation versus how that person perceives it themselves. It teaches that outsiders often show concern or pity for someone who doesn't see their own situation as pitiable. The proverb cautions against assuming others need our sympathy when they may have a different understanding of their circumstances. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the value placed on personal perspective and the recognition that external judgment may be misplaced. It reminds us that before feeling sorry for others, we should consider whether they actually see themselves as unfortunate.\n\n- References: The proverb's meaning is reinforced by Similar Phrase 1 \"\u00c0 \u0144sunk\u00fan Aw\u00fagb\u00f3, Aw\u00fagb\u00f3 \u00f2 sunk\u00fan ara-a \u1eb9\u0300\" which follows the same pattern of outsiders crying for someone who doesn't cry for themselves, and Similar Phrase 2 \"M\u00e9l\u00f2\u00f3 l\u00c8j\u00ecgb\u00f2 t\u00ed \u1ecd\u0300kan \u1eb9\u0300 \u0144j\u1eb9\u0301 Ay\u00e9-gbogbo?\" which questions the validity of outsider perspectives.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"Gbogbo \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n n\u00ed \u0144sunk\u00fan-un B\u00e1nj\u1ecd; \u1e63\u00f9gb\u1ecd\u0301n B\u00e1nj\u1ecd \u00f2 sunk\u00fan ara \u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"Everyone cries for Banjo, but Banjo does not cry for himself.\" It teaches that others often feel sorry for someone who doesn't feel sorry for themselves, highlighting the gap between external perceptions and personal experience.

This proverb emphasizes that things are defined by their actions or results, not just by their appearance or claims.\n3. There's a theme of authenticity and appropriate response based on demonstrated behavior.\n\nInterim Insight: The original proverb suggests that the most effective way to deal with someone is to use methods they understand or that match their own approach - especially when dealing with difficult people.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It is the mute person's sword that is used to kill a mute person.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that the most effective way to address a challenge is to use methods familiar to or derived from the source of the challenge itself. When dealing with difficult people or situations, using approaches they understand or that match their own tactics is often most effective. The proverb specifically uses the image of a mute person, suggesting that specialized knowledge or insider understanding is needed to effectively address specialized challenges. This reflects the Yoruba wisdom of strategic thinking and cultural emphasis on appropriate, targeted responses rather than generic solutions.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces that things must be addressed according to their demonstrated nature. Similar Phrase 2 emphasizes that authentic action defines identity and determines appropriate response.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"Id\u00e0 ahun la fi \u0144pa ahun\" literally means \"It is the mute person's sword that is used to kill a mute person.\" In Yoruba wisdom, this conveys that the most effective way to address a challenging person or situation is to use methods derived from or familiar to that very source. Just as only another mute person fully understands how to communicate with a mute person, sometimes the solution to a problem must come from understanding the problem's own nature. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of strategic wisdom and appropriate, targeted responses rather than generic approaches."

In the main proverb, there's a similar contrast between children and adults with mentions of food (o\u00fanj\u1eb9) and rings (\u00f2r\u00f9ka).\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the proverb may be about inappropriate actions or mismatched relationships between children and adults, particularly around things that can fit (food entering an adult's body, but a child's ring not fitting an adult's finger).\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A small child's food can enter an adult's stomach; a small child's ring cannot fit on an adult's finger.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eccm\u1ecdd\u00e9 n\u00ed \u1eb9\u1eb9\u0301ta l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301, \u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00ed \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9 w\u00e1 k\u00e1 \u1e63er\u00e9 ow\u00f3; \u1eb9\u1eb9\u0301ta-\u00e1 ha t\u00f3 \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9\u00fa s\u00fa epo l\u00e1?\" translates roughly to \"A child has three cowries and invites \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9 (a deity) to come play a money game; are three cowries enough for \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9 to buy palm oil?\"\n2. This phrase highlights the disparity between a child's limited resources and an adult deity's needs - suggesting naivety on the child's part.\n3. It reinforces the idea of improper scale or mismatch between what children offer and what adults require.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase emphasizes the mismatch of scale between children and adults, particularly regarding possessions and needs. It suggests the main proverb is about recognizing differences in capacity and scale between generations.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A small child's food can enter an adult's stomach; a small child's ring cannot fit on an adult's finger.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the selective nature of sharing or exchanges between generations. While adults can consume and benefit from what children offer as food (metaphorically including their ideas, contributions, or resources), not everything from children is suitable for adults (like their rings won't fit adult fingers). It teaches humility to adults - they should accept valuable contributions from younger people even while recognizing differences in capacity and experience. It also speaks to the natural limitations in generational exchanges while encouraging openness to what can be shared. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the balanced respect between generations: respecting elders' wisdom while also acknowledging that youth can contribute meaningfully to society.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase warns against inappropriate actions, reinforcing the proverb's lesson about recognizing proper relationships. The second similar phrase highlights the limitations of what children can offer adults, emphasizing the need for realistic expectations in cross-generational exchanges."

This suggests limitations of capability - someone in a diminished state (sleep-walker) cannot accomplish a difficult task (catching an eagle).\n3. The mention of \"\u1eb9l\u1eb9\u0301\u1e63in\" (horseman/horse owner) in our target proverb likely connects to themes of capability, status, and expectations.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb may deal with matching appropriate actions to capabilities, particularly regarding someone of status (horseman).\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Pull it inside\" is what befits the horseman/horse owner.\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1 \u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 l\u00e9 ohun t\u00ed a \u00f2 l\u00e8 gb\u00e9.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

This conveys wisdom about not attempting tasks beyond one's capability or overreaching.\n3. Connected to our proverb, it suggests the horseman is being advised to take appropriate action within his means - pulling the horse inside rather than attempting something more difficult or unsuitable.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces that our proverb likely advises taking appropriate action according to one's position and capabilities, rather than attempting unsuitable actions.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Pull it inside\" is what befits the horseman.\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb advises that a horseman should focus on actions appropriate to his status and capabilities - specifically bringing the horse inside rather than leaving it outside or attempting something beyond what's expected. It speaks to the importance of fulfilling one's responsibilities according to one's station in life. The proverb teaches that wisdom lies in knowing what actions are appropriate to one's role and executing them properly, rather than neglecting basic duties or overreaching. In Yoruba culture, where social roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, this proverb reminds people to fulfill the expectations of their position.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase about the sleep-walker unable to catch the eagle illustrates limitations of capability, while the second phrase about not placing hands on what one cannot lift reinforces the wisdom of acting within one's means and appropriate role."

This phrase establishes a cultural perspective about natural order and inherent limitations - each entity has its place and capabilities in the Yoruba worldview.\n3. The phrase uses parallel structure comparing humans (men) to nature (trees) to emphasize natural law and order.\n4. It suggests that certain actions are inappropriate or unnatural for specific beings based on their inherent nature.\n\nInterim Insight: The original proverb likely deals with natural limitations and appropriate roles - suggesting that certain beings shouldn't attempt tasks beyond their capability or nature, similar to how men shouldn't wail or male trees shouldn't produce sap in Yoruba cultural understanding.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.\n\nTranslation: \"A dog does not go to the deep forest to hunt a tiger/leopard.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00f2 b\u00e1 \u1e63e ohun \u1eb9\u0300r\u00f9, \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed s\u00e1.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00f2 b\u00e1 \u1e63e ohun \u1eb9\u0300r\u00f9, \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed s\u00e1\" translates to \"If an elder does not do something frightening, a child will not run away\" - suggesting that leadership example determines followers' actions.\n2. This phrase emphasizes hierarchy, responsibility, and proper social order in Yoruba culture.\n3. It implies that those with greater power or status set boundaries and examples for those with less.\n4. There's a concept of proportionality - actions should match one's capacity and position.\n\nInterim Insight: The original proverb about dogs not hunting tigers reflects wisdom about understanding one's limitations and not challenging those far more powerful than oneself - similar to how the relationship between elders and children establishes proper boundaries of behavior and respect for natural hierarchies.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A dog does not go to the deep forest to hunt a tiger/leopard.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb advises against overestimating one's abilities or challenging opponents who far exceed one's capacity. In Yoruba culture, understanding one's place in the natural and social order is valued wisdom. The proverb uses the imagery of a small domestic animal (dog) attempting to hunt a powerful wild predator (tiger/leopard) to illustrate the foolishness of attempting tasks beyond one's capability. It teaches humility, self-awareness, and respect for natural limitations. It can be applied to social situations, business ventures, or any context where recognizing power differentials is crucial for survival and success.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 established the cultural concept of natural limitations, while Similar Phrase 2 reinforced the importance of hierarchy and proportional action in Yoruba wisdom traditions.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"Aj\u00e1 k\u00ec \u00ed l\u1ecd s\u00e1ginj\u00f9 l\u1ecd \u1e63\u1ecdd\u1eb9 \u1eb9k\u00f9n\" translates to \"A dog does not go to the deep forest to hunt a tiger/leopard.\" It warns against attempting tasks far beyond one's capabilities or challenging those significantly more powerful than oneself.

This suggests that \"\u00e0p\u00e1r\u00e1\" refers to a slap or confrontation, and there's a connection between a big slap and creating fire or conflict.\n3. The second part implies that once a conflict starts, it cannot easily be controlled or stopped (like fire cannot avoid water).\n4. There appears to be a cause-and-effect relationship between \"\u00e0p\u00e1r\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1\" (a big slap) and something that follows.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely deals with how provocative actions lead to inevitable conflicts or consequences that cannot be easily controlled once set in motion.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A big slap creates a fight\" or \"A great slap leads to conflict.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1ecc\u0300y\u00e1j\u00fa-u ba\u00e1l\u00e9 n\u00ed \u0144p\u00e0d\u00e9 \u00ecb\u00f2s\u00ed l\u1ecd\u0301n\u00e0.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1ecc\u0300y\u00e1j\u00fa-u ba\u00e1l\u00e9 n\u00ed \u0144p\u00e0d\u00e9 \u00ecb\u00f2s\u00ed l\u1ecd\u0301n\u00e0\" roughly means \"The rashness/arrogance of the head of household is what meets disgrace on the way.\"\n2.

In Yoruba culture, this reflects the understanding of social harmony and the importance of measured responses. The proverb serves as a warning against initiating aggression or disrespect, as such actions will have predictable consequences. It embodies the Yoruba philosophy of cause and effect in social interactions and the natural order of justice where actions receive their due responses. It's both descriptive (explaining how conflicts start) and prescriptive (advising against provocative behavior).\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the cause-effect relationship between provocative actions and their consequences. Similar Phrase 2 adds the cultural dimension of how pride or arrogance leads to predictable negative outcomes.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0p\u00e1r\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1, \u00ecj\u00e0 n\u00ed \u0144d\u00e0\" translates to \"A big slap inevitably leads to a fight.\" It teaches that provocative actions naturally provoke responses in kind, warning against initiating conflict or disrespect. In Yoruba wisdom, this reflects understanding of social cause and effect - that one should not be surprised when aggressive actions result in proportional reactions.

Both phrases share the repetitive \"\u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn\" structure, suggesting monotony or repetition of the same thing.\n2. Both mention \"\u1eb9tu\" (antelope/duiker) and \"\u00edgb\u00f3\" (forest), indicating a forest hunting context.\n3. Both end with rhetorical questions asking if antelope is the only animal in the forest.\n4. \"\u00c0n\u00e1n-m\u00e1n\u00e0\u00e1n\" and \"on\u00ed-m\u00f3n\u00ec\u00ed\" in the similar phrase represent \"yesterday\" and \"today,\" similar to \"\u00f2n\u00ed\" (today) and \"\u1ecd\u0300la\" (tomorrow) in the original proverb.\n\nInterim Insight: This proverb appears to criticize fixation on a single option when many alternatives exist. The hunter who keeps bringing home only antelope is being questioned about their limited vision or effort.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Today, antelope meat again, tomorrow, antelope meat again; is antelope the only animal in the forest?\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: L\u00e1gb\u00e1j\u00e1 \u00ecb\u00e1 w\u00e0 a di \u00ecj\u00edm\u00e8r\u00e8; \u1eb9ni t\u00f3 b\u00e1 n\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa di oloyo?\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase uses \"L\u00e1gb\u00e1j\u00e1\" (a placeholder name like \"So-and-so\") to talk about someone becoming \"\u00ecj\u00edm\u00e8r\u00e8\" (a baboon/monkey).\n2. The second part mentions \"\u1eb9ni t\u00f3 b\u00e1 n\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa di oloyo\" suggesting that whoever is in front becomes fortunate or blessed.\n3. This appears to be about opportunity, transformation, and the contrast between those who succeed and those who don't.\n4. When connected to our proverb, it reinforces the idea of alternatives and choices \u2013 not being limited to one path or option.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase adds the dimension of transformation and opportunity. In Yoruba worldview, one should not limit oneself to a single path when multiple opportunities exist.\n\n## Final Synthesis\n- Final Translation: \"Today, antelope meat again, tomorrow, antelope meat again; is antelope the only animal in the forest?\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes lack of variety, initiative, or imagination. It questions why someone would repeatedly do the same thing or choose the same option when alternatives exist. In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to encourage innovation, exploration of new opportunities, or to criticize someone who is stuck in a rut. It reflects the Yoruba value of resourcefulness and adaptability.

Literally translated as \"Today, antelope meat again, tomorrow, antelope meat again; is antelope the only animal in the forest?\", it questions why someone would continuously pursue the same thing when other options exist. It's used to encourage exploration, innovation, and taking advantage of diverse opportunities in life, reflecting the Yoruba cultural value of resourcefulness."

Both phrases seem to describe situations where an action is performed with the ulterior motive of initiating dialogue.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with indirect communication strategies, where an action is taken not for its own sake but to provoke a response or conversation.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A wife who beats her stepchild wants to hear words (or wants to provoke a conversation).\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"On\u00ed\u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 t\u00f3 j\u00f3 t\u00ed k\u00f2 gb\u1ecdn y\u1eb9\u0300r\u00ec: \u00e0b\u00f9k\u00f9-u \u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 k\u1ecd\u0301; \u00e0b\u00f9k\u00f9 ara \u1eb9\u0300 ni\" roughly translates to \"A Sango worshipper who dances but doesn't tremble: it's not Sango who is disgraced, but the person themselves.\"\n2. This phrase emphasizes personal responsibility and how one's improper actions reflect poorly on oneself, not on what they represent.\n3. It highlights the Yoruba cultural value of appropriate behavior in social contexts and hierarchy.\n4. Applied to our proverb, it suggests the wife's behavior toward her stepchild reflects on her character, not necessarily on the child.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase adds a dimension of personal accountability and social judgment to our understanding of the proverb - improper actions reveal one's true character and motives.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A wife who beats her stepchild is simply looking for conversation (or trouble).\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb reveals the complex family dynamics in polygamous households. It suggests that when a wife mistreats her stepchild (her co-wife's child), her real intention is not discipline but to provoke a reaction or conflict with the child's mother or other family members. The proverb speaks to the indirect communication patterns in Yoruba culture, where actions often carry hidden agendas. It warns against using innocent parties (children) as pawns in adult conflicts and highlights how such behavior exposes one's true character. In traditional Yoruba society, harmony in extended families is highly valued, and this proverb serves as both a caution against and an interpretation of disruptive behavior in blended families.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase illustrates how actions can be invitations for dialogue in Yoruba communication patterns. The second phrase reinforces how inappropriate behavior reflects poorly on the individual rather than their position or what they represent, emphasizing personal accountability in Yoruba social ethics."

This phrase talks about social hierarchy and self-awareness within Yoruba society: \"Let the slave know himself as a slave; let the pawn know himself as a pawn; let the well-bred person know himself as God's servant.\"\n2. It emphasizes knowing one's place and position in life's hierarchy, suggesting proper self-awareness is a virtue in Yoruba culture.\n3. The reference to \"\u1ecdm\u1ecdl\u00faw\u00e0b\u00ed\" (person of good character) being \"God's servant\" suggests that even those of high status should maintain humility.\n\nInterim Insight: The concept of \"m\u1ecd \u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300n ara\" (knowing one's measure/limits) appears central to both phrases, suggesting the proverb relates to understanding one's position, capabilities, or limitations.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Since the day I've been coming, I've never seen anything like this\": the owner knows his own limits/worth.\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \"Mo m\u1ecd\u0300w\u1ecd\u0300n ara-\u00e0 mi\" k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63\u1eb9\u0300r\u1eb9\u0300k\u1eb9\u0301 \u00e8\u00e9b\u00fa.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase translates to \"'I know my limits' is not a form of insult\" - suggesting that acknowledging one's limitations is honorable, not shameful.\n2. It reinforces that self-awareness and recognizing boundaries is valued in Yoruba culture.\n3. The phrase connects self-knowledge with dignity and wisdom rather than weakness.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase adds that knowing one's limitations is positive and respectable, not something to be ashamed of. This helps us understand that the proverb is about the wisdom in recognizing one's own capabilities and boundaries.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n\n- Final Translation: \"When someone says 'I've never seen anything like this before,' it means the owner knows his own limits.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the wisdom of self-awareness and knowing one's limitations. When someone expresses surprise or amazement at something unusual, it indicates they recognize the boundaries of their own experience and knowledge. In Yoruba culture, acknowledging one's limitations is considered virtuous and a sign of wisdom, not weakness. The proverb teaches that understanding your place in the world and the extent of your abilities leads to proper conduct and humility. It also implies that expressing wonder at new experiences demonstrates honesty about the limits of one's knowledge.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 establishes the importance of knowing one's place in various social positions, while Similar Phrase 2 reinforces that acknowledging one's limitations is honorable and respected in Yoruba culture.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb means that expressing surprise at something new demonstrates self-awareness about one's limitations, which is considered a virtue in Yoruba culture. Knowing and acknowledging your boundaries reflects wisdom and good character, not weakness."

This phrase emphasizes the importance of having a recognized identity or status in Yoruba culture.\n3. It suggests that everyone should have some form of recognition or position in society.\n4. The phrase implies that identity and social standing are fundamental to one's place in the community.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase helps us understand that in Yoruba culture, having an identity or recognized position in society is highly valued, which will be relevant to interpreting our target proverb.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Not having the opportunity to rule is better than saying 'My voice cannot reach the whole town.'\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00ccgb\u00e0 wo ni M\u00e1k\u00f9\u00fa \u00f2 n\u00ed\u00ed k\u00fa?

This phrase warns about the dangers of attempting things you're not prepared for or qualified to do.\n3. It suggests that attempting to take on responsibilities beyond one's capacity can lead to failure or harm.\n4. There's an implied value of self-awareness and recognizing one's limitations.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase reinforces the idea that one should be realistic about their capabilities and limitations, which adds depth to our understanding of the main proverb.\n\n## Final Synthesis\n\n- Final Translation: \"Not having the opportunity to rule is better than saying 'My voice cannot reach the whole town.'\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches about humility, self-awareness, and dignity. It suggests that it's better to not have power at all than to have a position of authority but be ineffective or incapable of fulfilling its responsibilities. In Yoruba culture, leadership comes with expectations of effectiveness and impact. The proverb criticizes those who accept positions but then make excuses for their ineffectiveness (\"my voice cannot reach the whole town\"). It encourages people to honestly assess their capabilities before taking on responsibilities, as having a title without the ability to fulfill its duties is worse than not having the title at all. The proverb values integrity and effectiveness over mere status or titles.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase highlights the cultural importance of having recognized status in society, while the second phrase warns against taking on responsibilities beyond one's capacity. Together, they frame the main proverb as a teaching about the proper relationship between status, capability, and responsibility in Yoruba culture."

It refers to borrowed trousers (\u1e63\u00f2k\u00f2t\u00f2) and suggests that if they don't fit properly, they will embarrass the wearer.\n3. The ending suggests that one's own possessions fit or suit one best.\n4. The imagery centers on clothing that doesn't belong to you causing discomfort or embarrassment.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests the proverb is about how borrowed items (particularly clothes) don't suit a person as well as their own possessions, and may even cause embarrassment or difficulty.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Borrowed money does not suit one; borrowed trousers do not suit a person; if it doesn't fit one's legs it becomes awkward/uncomfortable; one's own things are what suit one.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

It states that another person's adornment/decoration doesn't suit one, and borrowed trousers don't suit a person.\n3. This adds the dimension of appearance and social perception - borrowed finery doesn't enhance one's dignity.\n4. The repeated use of \"\u00f2 y\u1eb9\" (does not suit/fit) emphasizes the mismatch between borrowed items and the borrower.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase confirms the proverb is about authenticity and the importance of using what naturally belongs to you rather than borrowed possessions, which extends beyond physical fit to social appropriateness.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"Borrowed money does not suit one; borrowed trousers do not suit a person; if they don't fit one's legs they become awkward; one's own possessions are what truly suit one.\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb emphasizes authenticity and self-reliance. It uses the concrete imagery of ill-fitting borrowed trousers to illustrate the broader principle that borrowed possessions\u2014whether material goods or affected mannerisms\u2014never truly suit a person. The proverb warns against pretentiousness and living beyond one's means. In Yoruba culture, this reflects values of contentment, authenticity, and the importance of living within one's natural circumstances rather than putting on appearances with borrowed resources. The wisdom suggests that dignity comes from authenticity rather than pretense, and that one should take pride in what is genuinely one's own rather than depending on others' possessions.\n\n- **References:** Both similar phrases reinforce the central message about borrowed items not suiting the borrower, with specific mention of borrowed trousers (\u1e63\u00f2k\u00f2t\u00f2 \u00e0gb\u00e0b\u1ecd\u0300) as a tangible example that would resonate in everyday Yoruba life.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe proverb \"\u00c0-w\u00edn-n\u00e1-w\u00f3 \u00f2 y\u1eb9ni; \u00e0-gb\u00e0-b\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd \u1e63\u00f2k\u00f2t\u00f2 \u00f2 y\u1eb9 \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n; b\u00ed k\u00f2 f\u00fanni l\u1eb9\u0301s\u1eb9\u0300 a d\u00f2r\u00f2g\u00ed; oh"

The similar phrase \"A \u00f2 m\u1ecd ohun t\u00ed D\u00e1r\u00f2-\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f3 t\u00f3 w\u00ed p\u00e9 ol\u00e8-\u00e9 k\u00f3 \u00f2un\" translates roughly to \"We don't know what Daro said before claiming that he was robbed.\"\n2. This suggests the proverb is about someone (D\u00e1\u00e0r\u00f3) who claims to be a victim (of theft) but we don't know the full story or what preceded this claim.\n3. The phrase implies skepticism about someone's account of events - specifically questioning what happened before they made their accusation or claim.\n\nInterim Insight: This proverb appears to be about questioning the credibility of someone's claims, particularly when they present themselves as a victim without providing context of what happened before.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"What did Daaro say before claiming that he was robbed?\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The second phrase about the tortoise (\u00c0j\u00e0p\u00e1) translates approximately to \"The tortoise says nothing is like what we already know how to do; he says if he puts an egg in his mouth, he will spit out palm kernel.\"\n2. This Yoruba phrase illustrates how someone might make implausible claims about their abilities or experiences.\n3. The tortoise is a common character in Yoruba folktales who often represents cunning, deception, and making false claims.\n4. This connects to the Daaro proverb by highlighting how people may make dubious claims without evidence or logical background.\n\nInterim Insight: Both phrases deal with credibility and the gap between claims and reality. The tortoise example reinforces that the Daaro proverb is about questioning suspicious claims that don't align with what we know to be possible or true.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"What did Daaro say before claiming that he was robbed?\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb encourages critical thinking and skepticism toward one-sided accounts. It suggests we should question what preceded someone's claim of victimhood, as they may have omitted important context that changes how we interpret the situation. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would be invoked when someone appears to be presenting themselves as a victim while potentially hiding their own role or provocation in the matter. It warns against accepting accusations at face value without understanding the full sequence of events.\n\n- **References:** The first similar phrase reinforces the proverb's skepticism about incomplete narratives. The second phrase about the tortoise connects to Yoruba oral traditions where the tortoise (\u00c0j\u00e0p\u00e1) frequently makes implausible claims, teaching listeners to question extraordinary claims that lack supporting evidence."

The shoulders carry loads worth five hundred, while the head sells its own for just twenty.)\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This similar phrase uses body parts (head and shoulders) to discuss relative value and capabilities.\n2. It highlights how one might undervalue their own contributions while overvaluing others.\n3. The numerical comparison (five hundred vs. twenty) creates a stark contrast to illustrate misperception of value.\n4. This suggests our target proverb may similarly involve numerical comparisons and questioning of values or choices.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our target proverb likely contains a rhetorical question that exposes a contradiction or poor judgment in comparing values.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The hunter of game is going hunting, and he asks, 'Is it five hundred game or six hundred game?'

This phrase cautions against thinking oneself unique or exceptional when in reality, one is quite ordinary.\n2. It highlights the folly of self-importance and exaggerated self-assessment.\n3. The phrase uses hyperbole (thousands upon thousands) to emphasize the commonness of supposedly unique traits.\n4. Applied to our target proverb, this suggests questioning hypothetical gains when you haven't secured anything tangible yet.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase reinforces that our target proverb likely criticizes counting or valuing something before it's actually obtained, showing presumptuous or foolish thinking.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"The hunter going hunting asks, 'Should I hunt five hundred game or six hundred game?' But which one have you actually caught yet?\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This proverb ridicules those who debate potential future gains or hypothetical choices when they haven't accomplished anything concrete yet. It criticizes counting one's chickens before they hatch. In Yoruba culture, it warns against premature celebration or planning based on presumed success. The hunter who hasn't caught anything yet is foolishly debating how many animals to catch, showing poor judgment and misplaced priorities. The proverb teaches pragmatism and focusing on actual achievements rather than hypothetical scenarios.\n\n- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 demonstrates the theme of misplaced values and incorrect self-assessment. Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the critique of foolish thinking and exaggerated self-importance that appears in the main proverb."

The similar phrase translates roughly to \"A diviner (babal\u00e1wo) won't be so hungry/desperate that he asks about yesterday's sacrifice.\" This suggests a theme about maintaining dignity despite desperation.\n2. \"Oj\u00fa p\u1ecd\u0301n\" refers to a state of hunger, desperation, or being in dire straits. In both proverbs, it suggests a threshold that shouldn't be crossed despite difficult circumstances.\n3. The babal\u00e1wo (diviner) in the similar phrase occupies a position of respect, similar to the \"ba\u00e1l\u00e9\" (head of household) in our target proverb.\n4. Both proverbs seem to address maintaining one's dignity and proper role despite hardship.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely addresses the importance of maintaining dignity and proper social roles even in difficult times. There are certain actions that would be beneath one's status regardless of desperation.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The head of the household won't be so desperate/hungry that he sweeps his own house with his hands.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: Oj\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed p\u1ecd\u0301n \u1eb9dun k\u00f3 d\u1eb9ni il\u1eb9\u0300; \u00ec\u1e63\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63\u1eb9\u0301 ig\u00fan k\u00f3 di oj\u00fagb\u00e0 ad\u00ec\u1eb9.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase translates approximately to \"A monkey won't be so hungry that it descends to the ground; a vulture won't be so hungry that it becomes a chicken's equal.\" This reinforces the theme of maintaining one's natural position despite hardship.\n2. The phrase uses animal symbolism to convey how certain creatures maintain their natural position despite hunger or desperation.\n3. Like the target proverb, it emphasizes boundaries and maintaining proper place in a hierarchy.\n4. This adds the cultural context that in Yoruba society, there are natural orders and hierarchies that should be respected even when circumstances are difficult.\n\nInterim Insight: The target proverb specifically addresses roles within the household and social hierarchy. In traditional Yoruba culture, certain tasks were assigned to specific people based on status, and violating these norms would be seen as degrading one's dignity and status.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The head of the household won't be so desperate or hungry that he sweeps his own house with his hands.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining social hierarchy and dignity regardless of circumstances. In traditional Yoruba society, the head of the household (ba\u00e1l\u00e9) holds a position of respect and authority. Certain menial tasks like sweeping would typically be done by others in the household. The proverb teaches that even in difficult times, one should maintain dignity appropriate to one's station. It speaks to the broader cultural value of preserving social order and the proper roles assigned to different members of society. The proverb cautions against compromising one's status and dignity even when facing hardship.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces this by showing how a diviner (another respected position) maintains dignity despite hunger. Similar Phrase 2 uses animal imagery to show how creatures maintain their natural position in the hierarchy of life regardless of difficulties.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"Oj\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed p\u1ecd\u0301n ba\u00e1l\u00e9 il\u00e9 k\u00f3 f\u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 gb\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300 il\u00e9 \u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"The head of the household won't be so desperate or hungry that he sweeps his own house with his hands.\" It reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on maintaining proper social roles and personal dignity regardless of circumstances.

This speaks to the importance of social responsibilities and roles within Yoruba culture - it's better not to have a position than to fail at it\n3. This relates to the main proverb which seems to discuss proper greetings based on social roles and positions\n\nInterim Insight: Both proverbs deal with social protocols and appropriate behavior based on one's position in society, emphasizing the importance of knowing and fulfilling one's social obligations.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Good day household\" is not appropriate for household members; \"Welcome visitor\" is not appropriate for someone who is coming as a visitor; one who doesn't greet appropriately with \"Welcome visitor\" will lose the \"Good day household\" greeting.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The phrase \"Ibi t\u00ed a ti m\u00fa \u1ecd\u0300l\u1eb9 \u00f2 k\u00fann\u00e1; ibi t\u00ed a ti m\u00fa al\u00e1gb\u00e1ra\u00e1 t\u00f3 oko-\u00f3 ro\" translates roughly to \"Where a lazy person is caught doesn't require gathering firewood; where a strong person is caught requires tying them to a farm\"\n2. This proverb speaks to how different situations require different approaches - context matters in Yoruba social interactions\n3. It reinforces the idea in the main proverb that different greetings are appropriate for different people based on their status or relationship\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase reinforces the importance of context-appropriate behavior in Yoruba culture - different situations call for different protocols, just as different people should receive different greetings.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Household members don't greet each other with 'Good day household'; visitors aren't greeted with 'Welcome visitor'; whoever doesn't properly greet others with 'Welcome visitor' will lose receiving the 'Good day household' greeting.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb teaches about the importance of proper greetings and social etiquette in Yoruba culture. It highlights that appropriate greetings should be given based on one's status and relationship. Household members don't need to greet each other as if they were visitors to their own home, and visitors shouldn't be greeted as if they lived there. The deeper meaning is that if you don't acknowledge others properly according to their status, you will lose the respect and acknowledgment due to your own status. In Yoruba culture, greetings are not merely pleasantries but important social indicators that reinforce community bonds and respect hierarchies.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase emphasizes the importance of fulfilling social roles properly, while the second phrase reinforces that different contexts require different approaches - both supporting the main proverb's teaching about proper social etiquette.\n\nFinal Answer: This Yoruba proverb teaches that proper greetings based on social context are essential. It literally means that household members don't greet each other as visitors and vice versa, but its deeper meaning is that failing to acknowledge others properly will result in losing the acknowledgment due to yourself. In Yoruba culture, appropriate greetings are crucial social protocols that maintain harmony and respect in communities."

This phrase speaks to resilience and adaptability - facing life's circumstances as they come, with courage.\n3. It suggests that in Yoruba culture, there's a value placed on accepting situations and making the best of them.\n4. The phrase establishes a context of pragmatism in the face of circumstances beyond one's control.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests the main proverb might be about adapting to or accepting unexpected or unusual situations.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"What meat have we not eaten before? The frog met us with shoes and it ended up in a mess.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"Oj\u00fa \u00f2 r\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e1 r\u00ed; \u00f3 b\u00edm\u1ecd \u1eb9\u0300 \u00f3 s\u1ecd \u1ecd\u0301 n\u00ed \u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" translates roughly to \"The eye has never seen honor/wealth before; it gave birth to its child and named it 'Honor fills the mouth'.\"\n2. This phrase contains irony - something claiming or naming itself what it has no experience with.\n3. It speaks to presumption or pretentiousness - claiming attributes one doesn't possess.\n4. There's a cultural warning against false appearances or deceptive presentations.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase suggests the main proverb might involve irony, particularly around something presenting itself as what it is not, similar to the frog with shoes in the original proverb.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"What meat have we not eaten before? The frog met us wearing shoes and ended up as a mess (or food).\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb uses humor and irony to convey wisdom about pretentiousness and natural consequences. The imagery of a frog wearing shoes represents something attempting to be what it is not naturally meant to be. The proverb suggests that people who try to present themselves as something they're not will eventually be exposed or \"end up in a mess.\" It also conveys the Yoruba cultural value of authenticity and accepting one's true nature. The question \"What meat have we not eaten before?\" implies experienced wisdom - someone who has seen many unusual situations and isn't easily fooled by false appearances. Overall, it's a warning against pretension and a reminder that attempting to operate outside one's natural capabilities often leads to unfortunate consequences.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase reinforces the pragmatic approach to life's situations, while the second similar phrase highlights the theme of irony regarding false presentations or claims.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u1eb8ran k\u00ed la \u00f2 j\u1eb9 r\u00ed? \u1ecc\u0300p\u1ecd\u0300l\u1ecd\u0301 b\u00e1ni l\u00e1b\u00e0t\u00e0 \u00f3 ba b\u00far\u00fab\u00far\u00fa\" translates to \"What meat have we not eaten before?

In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb encourages authenticity while cautioning against false appearances, using the absurd image of a shoe-wearing frog to illustrate how unnatural behaviors often lead to downfall."

This phrase suggests an ironic situation where unsuitable people present themselves for important responsibilities.\n3. Both phrases use a structure that sets up a relationship between two types of people.\n4. There's an underlying theme of mismatched capabilities and responsibilities.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase helps us understand that the proverb likely deals with a situation where someone unsuitable takes on a responsibility, specifically someone who lacks the proper temperament.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The one who gets excessively angry is the one who finds/provides food for the one who gets mildly angry.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A-d\u00e1-m\u00e1-l\u00e8-\u1e63e \u00e0d\u00e0b\u00e0 t\u00ed \u0144d\u00fan b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" roughly translates to \"The incompetent dove that makes the loud noise.\" \n2. This phrase criticizes those who make big shows or noise despite lacking capability.\n3. It suggests a mismatch between one's abilities and their actions or claims.\n4. Like our proverb, it highlights irony in behavior - someone who shouldn't be in a position to help is the one offering help.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces that our proverb is about the irony of situations where those least suited for a task (due to their excessive anger) are the ones taking responsibility for others (who are less angry).\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The one who gets excessively angry provides food for the one who gets mildly angry.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the irony where someone with poor emotional control (the excessively angry person) somehow becomes responsible for taking care of someone with better emotional control (the mildly angry person). It speaks to situations where roles are reversed inappropriately - those who need guidance themselves are attempting to guide others. In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to criticize situations where authority or responsibility is given to those who lack the temperament or capability to handle it properly, similar to putting an unstable person in charge of caring for others.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 (\"We look for someone to entrust our child to, and the irresponsible one shows up\") and Similar Phrase 2 (\"The incompetent dove that makes the loud noise\") both reinforce the proverb's theme of mismatched capabilities and responsibilities."

This proverb speaks to appropriateness, dignity, and what is worthy of attention from important people.\n3. It suggests that some matters are too trivial or undignified for serious attention.\n\nInterim Insight: This reinforces the idea that the main proverb likely deals with triviality or insignificance - actions that might appear to have impact but are ultimately inconsequential.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The petty actions of an Ijesa person may seem to hurt but aren't significant.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to situations where someone's actions or words might seem offensive or harmful on the surface, but ultimately lack substance or significance. It characterizes these actions as \"p\u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0300p\u1eb9\u0301t\u1eb9\u0300\" (trivial or petty) and associates them with Ijesa people, suggesting a cultural stereotype about that subgroup. The proverb teaches discernment - the ability to distinguish between genuine threats or insults and those that are merely superficial. It encourages people not to overreact to minor provocations or to be overly concerned with trivial matters that may sting momentarily but cause no lasting harm.\n\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce the theme of distinguishing between appearance and reality. The first phrase shows the folly of exaggerated claims (like the main proverb's characterization of actions that seem harmful but aren't serious), while the second emphasizes the importance of not treating trivial matters with undue significance.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"P\u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0300p\u1eb9\u0301t\u1eb9\u0300 \u00ccj\u00e8\u1e63\u00e0, \u00f3 ta s\u1eb9\u0301ni l\u00e1ra k\u00f2 w\u1ecd\u0301n\" translates to \"The petty actions of an Ijesa person may seem to hurt but aren't significant.\" It teaches that some provocations or offenses may sting momentarily but lack real consequence or lasting impact. The proverb encourages wisdom in distinguishing between genuine threats and mere annoyances, suggesting that not everything that appears harmful deserves a serious response."

The similar phrase \"Ta n\u00ed \u0144j\u00e1j\u00e1 n\u00ed m\u1ecd\u0301\u1e63\u00e1l\u00e1\u1e63\u00ed?\" translates roughly to \"Who says the dog knows the mosque?\" This is questioning who claims a dog understands sacred spaces.\n2. This phrase, like our proverb, uses a dog (aj\u00e1) as a central figure and questions someone's understanding or behavior in relation to established norms.\n3. Both phrases use the interrogative structure \"Ta n\u00ed...\" (Who says/Who is...) to challenge an assumption.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely questions inappropriate behavior or misunderstanding of proper roles, using the dog as a metaphor for someone who doesn't understand proper boundaries or behaviors.\n\n### Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Who is eating while the dog is staring/salivating?\"\n\n### Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00ccw\u00e0 n\u00ed \u0144j\u1ecd on\u00edw\u00e0 l\u00f3j\u00fa.\n\n### Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00ccw\u00e0 n\u00ed \u0144j\u1ecd on\u00edw\u00e0 l\u00f3j\u00fa\" translates to \"Character/behavior is what makes its owner recognizable\" or \"One is known by one's character.\"\n2. This phrase emphasizes how behavior reveals one's true nature and identity in Yoruba culture.\n3. Applied to our proverb, it suggests that the act of eating while a dog stares hungrily reveals something about one's character - specifically, a lack of compassion or consideration.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase helps us understand that the proverb is making a judgment about character - specifically about selfishness, lack of sharing, or insensitivity to others' needs.\n\n### Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Who eats while a dog watches hungrily?\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes selfishness and insensitivity. In Yoruba culture, sharing food is a fundamental value that demonstrates good character. The proverb uses the imagery of someone eating while a hungry dog looks on longingly to illustrate callousness. It serves as a rhetorical question highlighting the impropriety of enjoying abundance while ignoring others in need. The dog represents any dependent or less fortunate person whose needs are being ignored. This proverb teaches the importance of compassion, sharing resources, and being mindful of others' suffering.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 contributes the dog imagery and questioning structure; Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of character judgment.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"Ta n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9un t\u00e1j\u00e1 \u0144j\u00f9r\u00f9?\" translates to \"Who eats while a dog watches hungrily?\" It criticizes selfishness and lack of compassion by questioning who would be insensitive enough to eat without sharing while someone else (represented by the dog) is obviously hungry. In Yoruba culture, this proverb teaches the moral importance of generosity, sharing, and being attentive to others' needs."

This refers to someone who is concerned with appearances but neglects the fundamentals or proper order of things\n3. \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa\" appears in both phrases, suggesting our proverb relates to people who are particular, elegant, or fastidious\n4. The similar phrase indicates that in Yoruba culture, there's recognition of people who have specific tastes or preferences, sometimes to their detriment\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely addresses how different personality types have different preferences or tastes, with \"af\u00ednj\u00fa\" referring to someone fastidious or particular about elegance and appearances.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The fastidious/elegant person eats iw\u1ecd (a type of vegetable); the wise/knowledgeable person eats kola nut; the impulsive/hasty person eats alligator pepper.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0fi ohun t\u00ed a k\u00ec \u00ed t\u00e0 l\u1ecd\u0301j\u00e0 l\u1eb9r\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\" translates to \"Only what is not sold in the market is what a slave cannot eat\" or \"A slave can only not eat what is not available in the market\"\n2. This second phrase speaks to limitations of choice or access based on social position\n3. It suggests that people's consumption or preferences are sometimes constrained by their circumstances or status\n4. When connected to our main proverb, it reinforces the idea that different types of people naturally gravitate toward different things\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb describes how people's choices or preferences are tied to their character or nature. Just as a slave can only access what's in the market, different personality types naturally gravitate toward certain foods or experiences that align with their character.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The fastidious person eats iw\u1ecd (vegetable); the wise person eats kola nut; the impulsive person eats alligator pepper.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb observes how people's preferences and choices reflect their fundamental character. The fastidious or elegant person (af\u00ednj\u00fa) chooses iw\u1ecd, a vegetable that requires careful preparation. The wise or knowledgeable person (\u1ecd\u0300m\u1ecd\u0300r\u00e0n) favors kola nut, which is associated with wisdom, ritual, and thoughtful social interaction in Yoruba culture. The impulsive or hasty person (m\u00e0r\u00ed-m\u00e0j\u1eb9) prefers alligator pepper, which provides immediate, strong sensation. The proverb teaches that our choices reveal our character, and different personalities naturally gravitate toward different things that suit their nature.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 highlights the importance of character and appearances in Yoruba culture. Similar Phrase 2 emphasizes how choices are connected to one's station or nature in life.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe proverb \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 iw\u1ecd; \u1ecd\u0300m\u1ecd\u0300r\u00e0n n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 ob\u00ec; m\u00e0r\u00ed-m\u00e0j\u1eb9 n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 aw\u00f9s\u00e1\" translates to \"The fastidious person eats iw\u1ecd; the wise person eats kola nut; the impulsive person eats alligator pepper.\" It reveals how our preferences reflect our character: the particular person chooses foods requiring careful preparation, the wise person favors the culturally significant kola nut associated with thoughtful ritual, and the impulsive person gravitates toward the immediate sensation of spicy alligator pepper. In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb teaches that our choices naturally align with and reveal our fundamental nature."

The similar phrase \"B\u00ed a k\u00f2 b\u00e1 t\u00ed\u00ec j\u00f3k\u00f2\u00f3, a k\u00ec \u00ed nas\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"If one hasn't sat down properly, one shouldn't stretch out one's legs.\" This conveys the importance of process, order, and patience.\n2. It suggests there's a proper sequence to things - certain prerequisites must be met before proceeding to the next stage.\n3. This relates to our main proverb in that both address consequences of not following proper order or ignoring necessary learning processes.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that the main proverb likely deals with skipping important steps or lessons and facing consequences as a result.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"If one does not heed the lessons being taught, one will continue to suffer repeatedly.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 ti m\u1ecd l\u00e0 \u0144k\u00fa; olongo k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00fa t\u00ecy\u00e0nt\u00ecy\u00e0n\" translates approximately to \"One dies as one lives/knows; a wise person doesn't die in confusion/disgrace.\"\n2. This proverb emphasizes that one's life choices determine one's end, and wisdom helps avoid unnecessary suffering.\n3. It relates to our main proverb by emphasizing the importance of wisdom and learning to avoid suffering.\n4. Both proverbs suggest that suffering often comes from ignoring available wisdom or lessons.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase reinforces that the main proverb is about the connection between learning from teachings/experiences and avoiding prolonged suffering.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"If one refuses to learn from the lessons being taught, one is destined to suffer repeatedly.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of heeding wisdom and instruction. In Yoruba culture, learning often comes through observation, listening to elders, and sometimes through difficult experiences. The proverb warns that refusing to learn from these teachings doesn't exempt one from the lessons - instead, it ensures the suffering will be prolonged and repeated. It reflects the Yoruba value of wisdom acquisition and respect for knowledge. The proverb serves both as a caution to the stubborn and as consolation to those enduring hardship while learning important life lessons.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the importance of proper order and process, while Similar Phrase 2 highlights how wisdom prevents unnecessary suffering. Together they frame the main proverb as part of Yoruba wisdom about learning, consequences, and the path to avoiding needless hardship.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed a k\u00f2 b\u00e1 t\u00f3 \u00ecy\u00e0-\u00e1 k\u1ecd\u0300 t\u00ed \u00e0 \u0144k\u1ecd\u0300 \u1ecd\u0301, \u00e0j\u1eb9k\u00fan \u00ecy\u00e0 l\u00e0 \u0144j\u1eb9\" means \"If one refuses to learn from the lessons being taught, one is destined to suffer repeatedly.\" It conveys the universal truth that ignoring lessons or refusing to heed wisdom doesn't exempt one from learning - it only guarantees continued suffering. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the high value placed on wisdom, proper learning processes, and respecting knowledge as a path to avoiding unnecessary hardship."

Both phrases mention \"\u1ecd\u0300f\u1ecd\u0301n-\u1ecd\u0300n\" (harmattan), the dry, dusty season in West Africa characterized by harsh conditions.\n3. The main proverb seems to reference making sacrifices to deities (\u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e0) during harmattan, suggesting timing or circumstances matter.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase warns against self-destructive reactions to difficult seasons, suggesting our main proverb may also caution against inappropriate timing or excessive actions during challenging periods.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One does not worship/sacrifice to a deity during harmattan; if it reaches the ground, it will scatter everywhere.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Ol\u00f3mele k\u00ec \u00ed s\u1ecd p\u00e9 igi y\u00f3 d\u00e0\u00e1 l\u00f3de l\u1ecd\u0301la\" translates to \"The woodcutter doesn't predict that wood will be scarce in the market tomorrow.\"\n2. This phrase suggests one shouldn't predict scarcity or future difficulties in one's own area of expertise or responsibility.\n3. It carries the notion of not speaking against one's own interests or creating problems through pessimistic predictions.\n\nInterim Insight: This adds the dimension of strategic timing and foresight - just as a woodcutter shouldn't predict wood scarcity (potentially harming his livelihood), one shouldn't perform important ritual actions during unfavorable conditions that would render them ineffective.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"One does not sacrifice to a deity during the harmattan season; if the offering reaches the ground, it will scatter everywhere.\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb teaches the importance of appropriate timing and conditions for significant actions. The harmattan season brings dry, dusty winds that would scatter offerings placed for deities, rendering the sacrifice ineffective or disrespectful. At a deeper level, it advises against pursuing important endeavors during unpropitious times. Just as one wouldn't destroy their home because of harsh weather (Similar Phrase 1), nor should one perform sacred duties when conditions will undermine them. And like the woodcutter who doesn't predict scarcity in his own market (Similar Phrase 2), one should be strategic about when to act, recognizing when conditions are favorable for success rather than setting oneself up for failure. The proverb ultimately counsels patience and wisdom in timing important actions.\n\n- **References:** Similar Phrase 1, Similar Phrase 2"

This suggests a connection to the town of Iwo in Yorubaland, and shows possessive relationships or identification.\n3. The phrase \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0300s\u00ed n\u00ed\" contains \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0300\" which appears similar to \"\u00ccw\u00f3\" from the similar phrase, suggesting a location-based reference.\n4. The similar phrase is asking about identification or ownership, which may relate to our proverb's meaning.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0300s\u00ed n\u00ed\" may be related to identification, location, or ownership based on the town of Iwo reference in the similar phrase.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"It is the left side\" or \"The left side is it\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00d2fin ni y\u00f3 s\u1ecd ara \u1eb9\u0300; \u00ecy\u00e0w\u00f3 t\u00ed \u0144na \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u00ecy\u00e1l\u00e9.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

This Yoruba proverb speaks about natural consequences or justice that will occur without intervention.\n3. It suggests that certain actions (like a junior wife beating a senior wife's child) will naturally lead to consequences without external judgment needed.\n4. The structure \"X ni\" in both phrases (\"\u00d2fin ni\" and \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0300s\u00ed n\u00ed\") suggests an emphatic declaration or identification.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0300s\u00ed n\u00ed\" may be emphasizing the left side as significant, perhaps indicating a directional preference or a metaphorical meaning about taking a certain path or position.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It is the left side\" or \"The left direction is it\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: In Yoruba culture, this proverb likely refers to directional significance. The left side (\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0300s\u00ed) in traditional Yoruba cosmology often has specific connotations. The phrase may be used to indicate a preference or direction one should take, either literally or metaphorically. It could be used in contexts where someone needs guidance on which path to choose, with the left side being emphasized as the correct option. The emphatic structure suggests certainty about this direction.\n- References: The identification aspect from Similar Phrase 1 and the emphatic declarative structure from Similar Phrase 2 inform this interpretation.\n\nFinal Answer: \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0300s\u00ed n\u00ed\" translates to \"It is the left side\" and represents a culturally significant directional instruction in Yoruba wisdom. This concise proverb provides guidance by emphasizing the left direction as the correct choice in a given situation, whether literal or metaphorical. In Yoruba cosmology, directional references often carry deeper cultural and spiritual significance beyond mere physical orientation."

The word \"l\u1ecd\u0301gb\u1ecd\u0301n\" appears in both phrases, referring to wisdom or intelligence.\n4. Both proverbs appear to address the relationship between physical limitations and wisdom.\n\nInterim Insight: This suggests that the main proverb might be about how physical limitations or disadvantages can lead to the development of wisdom as compensation.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"An elder who doesn't have feet on the ground has wisdom inside.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0gb\u00e9r\u00e9 l\u1eb9y\u1eb9 \u0144gb\u00e9; k\u00f2 l\u00e8 mu omi in\u00fa \u00e0gb\u1ecdn\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

It speaks to how certain behaviors or characteristics limit one's capabilities - the bird's restlessness prevents it from being still enough to drink from a coconut shell.\n3. This connects to the main proverb in that both speak about physical limitations and adaptations.\n4. It suggests that limitations in one area often lead to adaptations or strengths in another.\n\nInterim Insight: The main proverb appears to suggest that those with physical limitations often develop mental strengths to compensate, highlighting how wisdom often develops as a response to challenges.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"An elder who cannot stand firmly on the ground has wisdom within.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that physical limitations often lead to the development of mental acuity or wisdom. When someone cannot rely on physical strength or mobility, they develop intellectual capabilities instead. It celebrates the wisdom of those who have overcome physical challenges and emphasizes that wisdom can be a powerful compensation for physical limitations. The proverb encourages respect for elders and people with disabilities, recognizing that their perspectives and problem-solving abilities may be uniquely valuable precisely because of the challenges they've had to overcome.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 shows how wisdom can come from unexpected sources or circumstances, while Similar Phrase 2 illustrates how limitations in one area often necessitate adaptations or strengths in another.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0 t\u00ed k\u00f2 l\u1eb9\u0301s\u1eb9\u0300 n\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300 a l\u1ecd\u0301gb\u1ecd\u0301n n\u00edn\u00fa\" translates to \"An elder who cannot stand firmly on the ground has wisdom within.\" It teaches that people who face physical limitations often develop extraordinary mental capabilities to compensate. In Yoruba culture, this proverb acknowledges the valuable wisdom that comes from overcoming challenges and reminds us that physical disabilities don't diminish a person's worth or contribution to society - indeed, they may enhance their wisdom and problem-solving abilities through necessity and adaptation."

It's a powerful expression of the law of reciprocity or karma in Yoruba wisdom. The proverb warns that harm done to others, even secretly or \"behind their back,\" will eventually return to harm the doer. It encourages ethical behavior by highlighting the interconnectedness of all actions within the community.\n- References: The first similar phrase shows how character becomes visible, while the second emphasizes how wisdom manifests in careful, measured actions with awareness of consequences.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0 \u0144j\u00e1 \u00ecb\u00e0\u01f9t\u1eb9\u0301 \u1eb9\u0300 l\u1eb9\u0301h\u00ecn, \u00f3 \u0144j\u00e1 tar\u00e1 iw\u00e1j\u00fa\" translates to \"As one tears the apron at the back, one tears one's body in front.\" It teaches that harm done to others (even behind their back) ultimately returns to harm oneself. This reflects the Yoruba belief in cosmic justice and the interconnectedness of community. Like the similar phrases that show how character becomes visible in one's face and how wise elders move with deliberate caution, this proverb emphasizes that all actions have consequences that eventually come full circle to affect the doer."

This proverb suggests that a problem should be solved by the most appropriate person, not just anyone.\n3. Both proverbs involve animals (dog/wildcat in the similar phrase; leopard/tiger/civet cat in the main proverb).\n4. Both proverbs seem to address matters of appropriate roles, relationships, and responsibilities.\n\nInterim Insight: The main proverb likely deals with the importance of natural bonds, loyalty, and appropriate relationships, using wild animals as metaphors for different types of influences or authority figures.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A tribe/clan gave birth to me, a tiger/leopard raised me to adulthood, a civet cat adopted me; if there's no animal in the soup, I won't eat.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

This proverb emphasizes the importance of consulting those with direct connection or inheritance to a matter.\n3. It suggests that proper protocol requires respecting established relationships and lineages.\n4. The main proverb similarly addresses the concept of loyalty to one's upbringing and formative influences.\n\nInterim Insight: The main proverb appears to be about identity shaped by multiple influences, with the final clause suggesting unwavering loyalty to one's background - refusing to \"eat soup without meat\" metaphorically meaning refusing to abandon one's values or origins.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"My clan gave birth to me, a leopard raised me to adulthood, a civet cat adopted me; if there is no meat in the soup, I won't eat.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb speaks to the multiple influences that shape a person's identity and values. The imagery of powerful wild animals (leopard, civet cat) raising and adopting someone born into a human clan suggests diverse and formidable influences on one's upbringing. The final clause about refusing to eat soup without meat symbolizes unwavering loyalty to one's upbringing and formative influences - the person will not compromise on the core values instilled by their various \"guardians.\" In Yoruba culture, this reflects the importance of honoring one's lineage and the multiple communities that contribute to personal development, while maintaining integrity to the values they instill.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase reminds us that proper roles and relationships matter in solving problems. The second similar phrase reinforces the importance of respecting established connections and consulting those with direct lineage to a matter.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u1eb8\u0300y\u00e1 l\u00f3 b\u00ed mi, \u1eb9k\u00f9n l\u00f3 w\u00f2 m\u00ed d\u00e0gb\u00e0, ol\u00f3g\u00ecnn\u00ed gb\u00e0 m\u00ed t\u1ecd\u0301; b\u00ed k\u00f2 s\u1eb9\u0301ran l\u1ecd\u0301b\u1eb9\u0300 nk\u00f2 j\u1eb9\" means \"My clan gave birth to me, a leopard raised me to adulthood, a civet cat adopted me; if there is no meat in the soup, I won't eat.\" It speaks to how a person's identity is shaped by diverse influences (family, community, mentors) while emphasizing unwavering loyalty to the core values these influences instill. The person remains committed to their principles and refuses to compromise on what they've been taught to value, just as they would refuse soup without meat. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the importance of honoring one's origins"

The similar phrase \"K\u00f3-t\u00e1n-k\u00f3-t\u00e1n laj\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1 omi\" translates roughly to \"It is with lapping that a dog drinks water to completion\" - referring to how a dog drinks water bit by bit with its tongue until finished.\n2. This suggests a methodology of doing things gradually but completely, implying patience and persistence in a natural process.\n3. This connects to our main proverb which appears to discuss eating manners or customs related to completion and proper conduct.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that there are proper ways to do things, even if they seem tedious or time-consuming. This adds context that our main proverb likely comments on proper eating etiquette that should be followed despite urgency or hunger.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"After eating to satisfaction, after eating without knowing oneself, using ten fingers to eat does not befit a human being.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: O k\u00f2 m\u1ecd \u1eb9\u0300w\u00e0 l\u00f3\u0144j\u1eb9 \u00e0-j\u1eb9-s\u00f9n.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

This reinforces the idea of mindful eating versus mindless consumption, suggesting cultural values of self-control and proper decorum even when satisfying basic needs.\n3. The phrase highlights how one's manner of eating reflects character and upbringing in Yoruba culture.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase emphasizes the cultural importance of eating with mindfulness and proper manners, which reinforces that our main proverb is a commentary on maintaining dignity and proper conduct even when very hungry.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Even when fully satiated, even when eating with abandon, using all ten fingers to eat is not befitting of a human being.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining proper etiquette and dignity regardless of circumstances. In Yoruba culture, eating with restraint and proper manners distinguishes humans from animals and demonstrates good upbringing and character. The proverb cautions against losing one's composure and civilized behavior even when extremely hungry or in informal settings. It teaches that while satisfying natural urges is necessary, how one does so reveals their true character and upbringing. This reflects the Yoruba emphasis on \u00ecw\u00e0 (character) and \u1eb9\u0300k\u1ecd\u0301 (training/education) as markers of a well-formed person.\n\n- References: The dog lapping water gradually (Similar Phrase 1) and the critique of mindless eating (Similar Phrase 2) both reinforce that there are proper ways to satisfy needs that preserve human dignity.\n\nFinal Answer: This Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0-j\u1eb9-t\u00e1n, \u00e0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-m\u1ecdra, k\u00e1 fi \u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 m\u1eb9\u0301w\u1eb9\u0300\u1eb9\u0300w\u00e1 j\u1eb9un \u00f2 y\u1eb9 \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n\" teaches that even when extremely hungry or eating abundantly, using all ten fingers (eating greedily or messily) is undignified and unbecoming of a proper human being. It emphasizes that maintaining proper manners and self-control, especially during eating, is a fundamental aspect of humanity and good character in Yoruba culture."

The similar phrase \"\u00d2ru \u00f2 mol\u00f3w\u00f3\" translates to \"The night/darkness does not recognize a person of status/wealth.\"\n2. Both phrases deal with darkness (\"\u00f2k\u00f9nk\u00f9n\" and \"\u00f2ru\") not recognizing or respecting human hierarchies.\n3. \"nIf\u00e1 t\u00ed \u00e0 \u0144d\u00e1 f\u00fan '\u00ccw\u1ecd ta n\u00ecy\u1eb9n?'\" refers to casting If\u00e1 divination for \"Who are you?\" - suggesting someone demanding recognition.\n4. The proverb appears to be addressing arrogance or demands for special treatment in circumstances where status doesn't matter.\n\nInterim Insight: This proverb likely speaks to how natural forces or certain circumstances don't discriminate based on social status or wealth - darkness treats everyone equally regardless of their importance.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Darkness does not recognize a person of respect/honor; it casts If\u00e1 divination for 'Who exactly are you?'\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

This phrase speaks to ingratitude and entitlement - complaining about imperfect gifts while not acknowledging one's true situation.\n3. This adds depth to our original proverb by suggesting it's about people who demand special treatment or recognition in situations where they don't deserve it.\n4. Both proverbs employ rhetorical questions to challenge someone's perspective.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb uses darkness as a metaphor for impartial forces that don't care about human status, and mocks those who still demand special recognition in such circumstances.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"Darkness does not recognize a person of honor; it asks divination for 'Who exactly are you?'\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb teaches that certain forces and situations in life (symbolized by darkness) are impartial and do not respect human hierarchies, status, or wealth. It mocks those who expect special treatment in circumstances where everyone is treated equally. The proverb serves as a humbling reminder that nature and many of life's circumstances do not discriminate based on who we think we are - challenging human arrogance and entitlement. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would be used to caution someone against expecting preferential treatment in situations where everyone faces the same challenges.\n\n- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of darkness as an equalizing force that ignores status. Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of entitlement and ingratitude that makes the cautionary message of the original proverb clearer."

This phrase suggests that one shouldn't involve a potentially more dangerous party to solve a delicate problem. The wildcat might harm the dog rather than help it.\n3. This suggests our target proverb likely deals with relationship dynamics and inappropriate interventions in situations.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase indicates our proverb may be about careful selection of mediators or interveners in sensitive situations, particularly when there are power dynamics or conflicts involved.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"If a wife becomes familiar with (or defiant toward) her husband, the mediator will withdraw (or step aside).\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed oj\u00fa b\u00e1 r\u00ed, \u1eb9nu a d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second phrase translates to \"When the eyes have seen, the mouth becomes silent\" - suggesting that some realities are so evident that they leave one speechless.\n2. This adds nuance to our original proverb by suggesting that when certain relationship dynamics become obvious, outsiders recognize they should not interfere.\n3. It reinforces the wisdom of non-intervention when a wife and husband have their own established dynamic, even if it appears problematic to outsiders.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase suggests our proverb concerns situations where the reality of a relationship becomes apparent, causing would-be interveners to recognize their input is unnecessary or unwelcome.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"When a wife becomes too familiar or defiant with her husband, the mediator withdraws.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the delicate nature of marital relationships and the wisdom of non-intervention. It suggests that when a wife feels comfortable enough to challenge her husband or shows disrespect, outside mediators should recognize this as a sign to step back. The proverb acknowledges that every marriage develops its own internal dynamics and communication patterns that outsiders may not fully understand. Even when these dynamics appear problematic to outside observers, intervention may be inappropriate or unwelcome. The proverb counsels wisdom in knowing when to involve oneself in others' affairs, particularly in intimate relationships where complex dynamics are at play.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase warns against bringing in potentially harmful interveners, while the second reminds us that sometimes observation alone should lead to respectful silence rather than intervention."

The imagery here is about someone of limited capacity (like a rag) attempting to carry something valuable (dried fish), which will likely result in the fish being ruined or spoiled.\n3. There's a connection to our main proverb through the concept of \"gb\u00e9\" (carrying) and \"j\u1eb9\u0301\" (ruining/spoiling).\n\nInterim Insight: Both phrases deal with the consequences of overestimating one's capacity or taking on roles beyond one's capabilities, leading to negative outcomes.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The person who is being lifted too high will ruin themselves.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9 oy\u00e8 \u1eb9nu \u1ecd\u0300n\u00e0 kal\u1eb9\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9 oy\u00e8 \u1eb9nu \u1ecd\u0300n\u00e0 kal\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"One does not enjoy chieftaincy at the entrance of the road.\" This suggests that positions of honor require proper positioning and context.\n2. This proverb warns against premature celebration or assuming authority in inappropriate contexts.\n3. It reinforces the idea that honor or elevation that comes too easily or in the wrong context is problematic.\n\nInterim Insight: This adds the cultural understanding that positions of honor or elevation come with proper context and responsibility. When one is elevated improperly or prematurely, it leads to one's downfall.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The person who is lifted too high will end up ruining themselves.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against seeking or accepting elevation beyond one's readiness or merit. In Yoruba culture, social hierarchy and proper timing for advancement are highly valued. The proverb teaches that when someone is promoted too quickly, given undue praise, or placed in a position they haven't earned or aren't prepared for, they will likely make mistakes that lead to their own downfall. It counsels humility and the importance of gradual, earned advancement rather than seeking shortcuts to positions of honor or responsibility.\n- References: The rag carrying dried fish beyond its capacity (Similar Phrase 1) and the improper enjoyment of chieftaincy status in an inappropriate location (Similar Phrase 2) both reinforce the cultural value of knowing one's place and the dangers of premature elevation.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8ni \u00e0 \u0144gb\u00e9 g\u1eb9\u0300g\u1eb9\u0300 ni y\u00f3 ba ara-a r\u1eb9\u0300 j\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"The person who is lifted too high will end up ruining themselves.\" It warns against accepting positions, praise, or status beyond what one has earned or is prepared for. In Yoruba wisdom, such unmerited elevation typically leads to one's own downfall, as the person will make mistakes due to their unreadiness. The proverb encourages appropriate timing, humility, and earned advancement rather than shortcuts to positions of honor."

It suggests that taking time to proceed cautiously is actually a path to success, not failure. The proverb counters the misconception that being cautious means being ineffective.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 (proper procedure and timing), Similar Phrase 2 (respect for order and proper approach)\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"T\u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0300 k\u00ec \u00ed t\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"Treading carefully does not mean one will fail.\" It teaches that proceeding with caution and deliberation is not a weakness but a strength that often leads to success.

The similar phrase \"\u00c0\u00ec-l\u00e8-j\u00e0 ni \u00e0 \u0144s\u1ecd p\u00e9 'Oj\u00fade baba-\u00e0 mi \u00f2 d\u00e9 \u00ech\u00edn'\" translates roughly to \"It is inability to fight that makes one say 'My father's courtyard does not extend to here.'\"\n2. This suggests making excuses for not confronting challenges, essentially indicating that people often create justifications for their limitations.\n3. The similar phrase reveals a cultural emphasis on recognizing pretexts used to avoid responsibility or confrontation.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that the main proverb may also deal with evasion, excuses, or confronting reality directly rather than avoiding it.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Whoever looks down (casts their eyes to the ground) will find their nose.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed oj\u00fa b\u00e1 r\u00ed, \u1eb9nu a d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"When the eyes see, the mouth becomes silent.\"\n2. This second phrase emphasizes how direct observation (using one's eyes) brings clarity that renders arguments or denial (the mouth's function) unnecessary.\n3. It suggests that confronting reality directly leads to understanding and acceptance.\n4. Both phrases share the theme of sensory organs (eyes, mouth, nose) as metaphors for perception and truth.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces the idea that the main proverb is about the relationship between perception, attention, and discovering obvious truths that are part of oneself.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One who looks down will find their nose.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that self-reflection leads to self-discovery. Just as your nose is always in your field of vision but you may not notice it until you consciously look down, the solutions to problems or self-knowledge are often already within your reach. The proverb encourages introspection and suggests that many answers we seek externally are actually part of us already. It also carries the subtle message that one doesn't need to search far and wide for something that is inherently part of oneself. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the value placed on self-awareness and recognizing one's own capabilities rather than making excuses (as reflected in Similar Phrase 1) or seeking external validation when the truth is already evident (as reflected in Similar Phrase 2).\n\n- References: The interpretation is informed by Similar Phrase 1 which warns against making excuses, and Similar Phrase 2 which emphasizes how direct observation reveals truth.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8n\u00ed b\u00e1 d\u1eb9 oj\u00fa-u r\u1eb9\u0300 s\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300 \u00e1 r\u00edm\u00fa-u r\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"One who looks down will find their nose.\" It teaches that self-reflection leads to self-discovery and that many solutions we seek are already within our reach, just as our nose is always in our field of vision. This proverb encourages introspection and recognizing one's inherent capabilities rather than seeking external answers or making excuses for not confronting one's reality."

This suggests a relationship dynamic where one party (visitor/guest) shouldn't burden or exploit another party (host/owner).\n3. The relationship appears hierarchical or transactional, with clear roles and responsibilities.\n4. It emphasizes ethical conduct in relationships and respecting boundaries.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely deals with a relationship between someone who has something and someone who uses or benefits from it, and proper conduct within that relationship.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The owner of beads leaves beads to accumulate; if the owner of beads had collected money (payment), it would not be easy to tie/string the beads together.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0\u1e63\u00e1 k\u00ec \u00ed r\u00e0 k\u00e1d\u00ec\u1eb9 gb\u00e9 k\u00f2k\u00f2r\u00f2 d\u00e1n\u00ed\" translates to \"The hawk doesn't catch prey so the chicken can eat insects forever.\"\n2. This highlights that predators or powerful entities don't act for the benefit of others, but for themselves.\n3. It suggests natural hierarchies and self-interest in relationships.\n4. The phrase reveals Yoruba understanding of transactional relationships and cautioning against naive expectations.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb is likely about economic transactions and fairness - suggesting that if the owner of something valuable (beads) had demanded payment, they would have lost the opportunity to benefit from the arrangement in the future.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The bead maker leaves beads to accumulate; if the bead owner had demanded immediate payment, it would not be easy to string the beads together later.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches about business wisdom and delayed gratification. It suggests that sometimes allowing resources or investments to accumulate without demanding immediate returns creates opportunities for greater future benefits. In traditional Yoruba economy, beads were valuable commodities that required craftsmanship to arrange. The proverb counsels patience in business dealings - demanding immediate payment might satisfy short-term needs but could prevent larger long-term benefits that come from allowing business relationships to develop naturally. It emphasizes the wisdom of strategic patience and investment rather than immediate profit-taking.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase warns against exploitative relationships, while the second reinforces the natural order of self-interest in transactions. Together they frame the proverb as guidance about balanced and far-sighted economic relationships in Yoruba culture."

Both proverbs begin with \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 ti...\" structure, indicating a conditional relationship about how things are done based on circumstances or abilities.\n3. Both proverbs appear to address themes of limitation, capability, and working within one's means.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the target proverb likely addresses how one's actions or approaches should be determined by one's capabilities or resources.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"We prepare according to what we know; one without a horse does not arrive at a gathering impressively/grandly.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed oj\u00fa b\u00e1 r\u00ed, \u1eb9nu a d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"B\u00ed oj\u00fa b\u00e1 r\u00ed, \u1eb9nu a d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"When the eyes see, the mouth becomes silent.\" This speaks to being humbled by direct experience or evidence.\n2. This proverb conveys acceptance of reality - when confronted with truth, arguments cease.\n3. This adds the dimension of humility and acceptance of one's actual circumstances to our understanding of the target proverb.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces that the target proverb likely addresses the importance of self-awareness and accepting one's actual capabilities rather than pretending to be what one is not.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One prepares according to one's knowledge and ability; a person without a horse cannot arrive impressively at a gathering.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that one should act within the scope of one's resources and capabilities. In traditional Yoruba society, riding a horse to an event was a sign of status and wealth. The proverb uses this imagery to convey that we should be realistic about our circumstances and not attempt to present ourselves as something we are not. It encourages authenticity and warns against pretension. The wisdom advises people to work with what they have rather than pretending to capabilities or resources they don't possess.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the idea of acting within one's means, while Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of humbly accepting reality rather than arguing against it.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 ti m\u1ecd l\u00e0 \u0144d\u00e9; a-l\u00e1\u00ec-l\u1eb9\u0301\u1e63in k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e9 w\u1ecd\u0300nw\u1ecd\u0300n\" translates to \"One prepares according to one's knowledge and ability; a person without a horse cannot arrive impressively at a gathering.\" This proverb teaches the importance of authenticity and living within one's means. In Yoruba culture, where communal gatherings are important social events, arriving on horseback symbolized status. The proverb uses this cultural reference to advise people to be honest about their capabilities and resources rather than putting on false appearances. It encourages self-awareness and cautions against pretension, reminding us that our actions should align with our actual circumstances and abilities."

This phrase emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and understanding one's limitations to avoid disaster or embarrassment.\n3. It suggests that even those with high status (elders) can face consequences if they don't recognize their boundaries.\n4. The river imagery represents natural forces or social consequences that overwhelm those who overestimate themselves.\n\nInterim Insight: Both proverbs appear to address self-awareness and the importance of knowing one's place or limits in society. The similar phrase warns of physical danger (being swept away) as a consequence of lacking self-awareness.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One who says 'I know my worth/limits' does not become the subject of mockery/insult.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0k\u00eds\u00e0-\u00e1 m\u1ecd \u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300n ara-a r\u1eb9\u0300, \u00f3 gb\u00e9 p\u00e1r\u00e1 j\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"The rag knows its worth/limit, so it stays on the shelf.\"\n2. This proverb uses the metaphor of a rag knowing its proper place (on the shelf rather than being worn as clothing).\n3. It reinforces the concept that understanding one's position prevents inappropriate actions and subsequent embarrassment.\n4. While the first similar phrase focused on consequences of not knowing limits, this one highlights the benefits of proper self-awareness.\n\nInterim Insight: All three proverbs emphasize self-awareness, but with different perspectives. The original proverb states the positive outcome of self-awareness (avoiding mockery), while the similar phrases illustrate either the negative consequences of lacking it or the appropriate behavior that results from having it.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One who says 'I know my worth/limits' will not become the subject of mockery or insults.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and humility in Yoruba culture. It teaches that those who understand their capabilities, limitations, and proper social position avoid embarrassment and ridicule. In Yoruba society, knowing one's place within the community hierarchy and acting accordingly is highly valued. The proverb suggests that self-awareness serves as protection against social humiliation. It encourages people to be realistic about their abilities and status, neither overreaching (which leads to failure and mockery) nor undervaluing themselves. This reflects the Yoruba emphasis on balanced living, social harmony, and the wisdom that comes from accurate self-assessment.\n\n- References: The river that carries away the unaware elder (Similar Phrase 1) and the rag that knows to stay on the shelf (Similar Phrase 2) both reinforce the consequences of ignoring one's proper place and the benefits of self-awareness."

The similar phrase \"A k\u00ec \u00ed p\u1eb9\u0300l\u00fa \u1ecd\u0300b\u1ecd j\u00e1ko\" translates to \"One does not go hunting with a monkey.\" This suggests the idea of being careful about partnerships or associations that might have inherent conflicts of interest.\n2. The similar phrase uses animal imagery (monkey) to convey wisdom about relationships, while our target proverb uses the king (\u1ecdba) as its central figure, suggesting hierarchical relationships and power dynamics.\n3.

This reinforces the idea in our target proverb that actions have consequences, especially when dealing with power structures.\n3. The second similar phrase emphasizes the inevitability of facing consequences, suggesting our proverb is about the natural repercussions of challenging authority.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces that the target proverb is about the inevitable consequences of one's actions, particularly when those actions involve challenging powerful figures.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"If you quarrel with the king, expect his vehicle to run over your foot.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns about the consequences of challenging authority. It teaches that when you oppose or disagree with powerful people, you should expect them to use their resources and influence against you. The proverb acknowledges the reality of power dynamics in society and advises caution when dealing with those in positions of authority. It's a practical warning that those who have power also control resources that can be used to retaliate against perceived opponents.\n- References: The first similar phrase warns about unwise associations, while the second emphasizes the inevitability of consequences, both supporting the interpretation that challenging authority naturally leads to repercussions.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed b\u00e1 \u1ecdba p\u00e0l\u00e0 k\u00ed \u1ecdk\u1ecd\u0301 \u1ecdba m\u00e1 \u1e63\u00e0n-\u00e1nni l\u1eb9\u0301s\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"If you quarrel with the king, expect his vehicle to run over your foot.\" This proverb warns about the natural consequences of challenging those in power. In Yoruba culture, which traditionally respected hierarchical structures with the king (Oba) at the top, this proverb acknowledges that powerful individuals have resources at their disposal that can be used against those who oppose them. It serves as practical wisdom about navigating power relationships, suggesting that one should be prepared for the consequences when challenging authority figures."

It suggests that when a person of higher status or authority (the elder) creates a problem for themselves (putting sand in their nose), it is not the place of someone with lower status or capability (the chicken) to attempt to solve it or confront them. The proverb teaches wisdom in knowing one's place, not interfering in matters beyond one's station, and recognizing that some problems should be solved by those who created them or by others with appropriate standing. In Yoruba culture, which values respect for elders and proper social conduct, this proverb would serve as a reminder about appropriate social boundaries and the wisdom of restraint.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of appropriate responsibility based on status. Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of wisdom in observing rather than confronting those who act inappropriately."

The phrase \"\u1e62\u00e0k\u00ec \u0144\u1e63e b\u00ed \u1ecd\u0300r\u00e1, egungun \u0144\u1e63e b\u00ed \u1eb9ran\" translates to \"Sackcloth pretends to be velvet, bone pretends to be meat.\"\n2. This phrase speaks to deception and false appearances - things pretending to be what they are not.\n3. When connected to our proverb, it suggests that in handling difficult situations, an elder doesn't approach things rashly or with false pretenses.\n4. The contrast between appearance and reality in this similar phrase helps us understand that the elder's approach to problems is genuine and authentic, not just for show.\n\nInterim Insight: An elder handles difficult situations with authenticity and wisdom, not pretending to have easy solutions but approaching problems in ways that don't cause harm.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"An elder handles difficult situations in ways that do not lead to death/destruction.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb emphasizes the wisdom that comes with age and experience in Yoruba culture. It teaches that elders approach problems with caution and careful consideration, seeking solutions that minimize harm rather than escalating conflicts. Elders are expected to defuse tensions and resolve issues peacefully, demonstrating patience and foresight. The proverb speaks to the value placed on preserving life and community harmony over quick but potentially destructive solutions. In Yoruba society, this reflects the respected role of elders as mediators and wise counselors who prioritize the community's wellbeing.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 (regarding elders not acting rashly), Similar Phrase 2 (regarding authenticity versus pretense)\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0-s\u1eb9\u0301-k\u00fa l\u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 \u0144s\u1eb9\u0301 \u1ecd\u0300r\u00e0n\" translates to \"An elder handles difficult situations in ways that do not lead to death/destruction.\" It speaks to the expectation that elders, with their accumulated wisdom, should approach problems carefully and seek peaceful resolutions that preserve life and harmony rather than exacerbate conflicts. This reflects the traditional Yoruba value system where elders serve as mediators and repositories of wisdom, expected to prioritize communal wellbeing over individual interests or quick but harmful solutions."

The similar phrase \"Ibi t\u00ed a ti m\u00fa \u1ecd\u0300l\u1eb9 \u00f2 k\u00fann\u00e1; ibi t\u00ed a ti m\u00fa al\u00e1gb\u00e1ra\u00e1 t\u00f3 oko-\u00f3 ro\" translates to \"The place where a lazy person is caught doesn't burn; the place where a strong person is caught that makes them work hard.\"\n2. This phrase suggests that consequences come to people based on their character and choices, not random circumstance.\n3. It emphasizes that lazy people are caught in situations that expose their laziness, while hardworking people face challenges that reveal their strength.\n4. This suggests our main proverb may also address how one's circumstances or behaviors lead to specific consequences.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase indicates that the main proverb likely concerns how one's conduct or situation determines how they are treated by others or by life circumstances.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Work/poverty doesn't catch a person from one place; suffering doesn't afflict a person from one place; if you walk in poverty, if you enter town with the face of poverty, they will use any kind of calabash to give you water to drink.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00ccgb\u00e0 wo ni M\u00e1k\u00f9\u00fa \u00f2 n\u00ed\u00ed k\u00fa?

Makuu doesn't know divination but takes the diviner's staff; Makuu doesn't know swimming but goes to the river.\"\n2. This phrase speaks about someone who engages in activities they're not qualified for or prepared for, inevitably leading to negative consequences.\n3. It suggests that actions have consequences, especially when one does not follow proper protocols or lacks necessary skills.\n4. This connects to our main proverb by reinforcing the idea that one's circumstances (like poverty) often result from their choices or behaviors.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase reinforces that the main proverb is about cause and effect - how one's actions and presentation in society determine how they will be treated.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Hardship doesn't suddenly befall a person from nowhere; suffering doesn't randomly afflict someone; if you walk around in poverty, if you enter town looking destitute, people will serve you water with whatever calabash they find.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that hardship and suffering don't usually happen by chance but are often the consequences of one's choices, behaviors, or presentation. The proverb specifically emphasizes that if you present yourself as poor or destitute (whether through appearance, behavior, or mindset), society will treat you accordingly - serving you water with any calabash rather than with honor or respect. In Yoruba culture, how one is served water (and in what vessel) indicates their social standing. The proverb warns against self-neglect and encourages people to carry themselves with dignity, as your self-presentation significantly influences how others treat you. It also contains wisdom about taking responsibility for one's circumstances rather than blaming external factors.\n\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce the proverb's central message about cause and effect in human circumstances. Similar Phrase 1 shows how people's character determines their challenges, while Similar Phrase 2 illustrates how improper actions lead to inevitable consequences.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThis Yoruba proverb teaches that our circumstances often reflect our choices and self-presentation. \"Hardship doesn't suddenly befall a person from nowhere; if you walk around looking destitute, people will serve you water with whatever calabash they find.\" In"

The similar phrase \"B\u00ed a k\u00f2 b\u00e1 t\u00ed\u00ec j\u00f3k\u00f2\u00f3, a k\u00ec \u00ed nas\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"If we haven't yet sat down, we don't stretch our legs\" - meaning one shouldn't be too comfortable or presumptuous before a situation is settled.\n2. This suggests a cultural value of showing proper respect, patience, and following appropriate timing and protocol in Yoruba culture.\n3. Both phrases seem to address timing, propriety, and showing respect to authority or tradition.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the proverb likely relates to observing proper timing and respecting authority figures (\u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301j\u1ecd\u0301 appears to be an authority figure or deity).\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation  \nTranslation: \"Let the sun set so that we may not have to argue with/offend \u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301j\u1ecd\u0301 (the chief/deity of the day).\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection  \nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eccl\u1ecdgb\u1ecd\u0301n kan \u00f2 ta k\u00f3k\u00f3 omi s\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd; \u1ecd\u0300m\u1ecd\u0300r\u00e0n kan \u00f2 m\u1ecd oye er\u00f9p\u1eb9\u0300 il\u1eb9\u0300.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2  \nChain-of-Thought:  \n1. The second similar phrase translates roughly to \"No wise person sprinkles water on their clothes; no sage knows the exact amount of dust on the ground\" - suggesting that even the wisest have limitations.\n2. This adds humility to the interpretation - acknowledging boundaries and not overreaching.\n3. In the original proverb, \u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301j\u1ecd\u0301 refers to a deity or authority figure whose domain or time should be respected.\n4. The concept relates to not challenging natural order or divine authority.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb teaches about respecting natural boundaries, timing, and authority figures. In Yoruba culture, there's wisdom in waiting for the appropriate time and not challenging the established order.\n\n## Final Synthesis:  \n- Final Translation: \"Let the sun set so we don't have to argue with/offend the deity of the day.\"\n  \n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches patience and respect for natural timing and spiritual authority. It advises that some activities should wait until the appropriate time (after sunset) to avoid offending spiritual powers or breaking taboos. In Yoruba traditional belief, different deities govern different domains and times, and respecting these boundaries shows wisdom. More broadly, it counsels against rushing activities that require specific timing or circumstances, and reminds us to respect established authority and natural order. It's similar to saying \"there's a time and place for everything.\"\n  \n- References: The first similar phrase emphasizes proper timing and protocol (not stretching legs before sitting properly), while the second acknowledges human limitations even among the wise (knowing when not to challenge authority or natural boundaries).\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"O\u00f2r\u00f9n, k\u00f3 t\u00ec\u1eb9 w\u1ecd\u0300 k\u00e1 m\u00e1 b\u00e0\u00e1 \u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301j\u1ecd\u0301 w\u00ed\" translates to \"Let the sun set so we don't have to argue with the deity of the day.\" It teaches the importance of timing, patience, and respecting spiritual authority. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would guide people to wait for the appropriate time to perform certain activities rather than rushing and potentially offending spiritual powers. The deeper wisdom applies to many contexts: respect established protocols, recognize when to act and when to wait, and understand that challenging the natural order often leads to unnecessary conflict."

This phrase speaks to the contrast between age and youthful desires, suggesting that aging physically doesn't always mean one loses interest in things associated with youth.\n3. It conveys the Yoruba cultural understanding that aging is a physical process that doesn't necessarily change one's inner desires or interests.\n4. This reveals a cultural emphasis on the disconnect that can exist between physical aging and mental/emotional aging.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests our main proverb likely deals with the contrast between physical aging and retaining youthful perspectives or appreciations.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"I have grown old, I have grown tall, but the play/activities of children has not ended in my eyes.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \"Mo m\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1n\" lOr\u00f2-\u00f3 fi \u0144gb\u00e9 \u1ecdk\u00f9nrin.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Mo m\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1n\" lOr\u00f2-\u00f3 fi \u0144gb\u00e9 \u1ecdk\u00f9nrin\" translates to \"'I know it completely' is how Oro takes away a man.\" This references the Oro cult in Yoruba tradition.\n2. This proverb warns against overconfidence or thinking one knows everything, as this is when danger can strike.\n3. It emphasizes the Yoruba cultural value of humility and continuous learning throughout one's life.\n4. The connection to our main proverb is about maintaining a learning mindset - like that of a child - even as one ages.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase adds the dimension that maintaining a childlike perspective includes humility and openness to learning, which are actually signs of wisdom in Yoruba culture, not immaturity.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Though I have grown old and tall, I still appreciate children's play/activities.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb embodies the Yoruba wisdom about healthy aging - that physical maturity should not eliminate one's ability to appreciate simplicity, playfulness, and joy that children naturally exhibit. It suggests that wisdom includes maintaining wonder, curiosity, and appreciation for simple pleasures despite advancing age. Unlike Western notions that sometimes rigidly separate childish behavior from adult behavior, Yoruba culture values the retention of certain childlike qualities throughout life as a sign of wisdom and balanced character. The proverb teaches that one can be physically mature while maintaining a fresh perspective on life, and that appreciating children's activities is not a regression but rather a sign of emotional intelligence and wholeness.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the tension between physical aging and youthful interests, while Similar Phrase 2 connects to the humility and continuous learning mindset that children naturally possess and that wise elders should maintain.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"Mo d\u00e0gb\u00e0 mo d\u00e0g\u00f3, ar\u00e9 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 \u00f2 t\u00e1n l\u00f3j\u00fa\u00f9 mi\" translates to \"Though I have grown old and tall, I still appreciate children's play/activities.\" It conveys the Yoruba wisdom that true maturity includes retaining the capacity to enjoy simple pleasures and maintaining a sense of wonder about life, similar to children. Rather than seeing adulthood as a complete departure from childlike qualities, Yoruba culture values the integration of childlike appreciation with adult wisdom. The proverb teaches that a balanced elder can maintain physical maturity while still finding joy and learning in the simplicity that children naturally embrace."

The similar phrase \"\u1ecck\u00f9nrin k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00e9, ak\u1ecd igi k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63oje\" literally translates to \"A man does not cry, a hardwood does not leak sap.\"\n2. This phrase expresses traditional Yoruba gender expectations - men are expected to show emotional restraint and strength.\n3. The phrase uses natural imagery (hardwood) to reinforce cultural ideas about masculinity.\n4. If this phrase describes masculine expectations, our target proverb likely deals with feminine expectations in Yoruba culture.\n\nInterim Insight: The target proverb likely deals with gender-specific behavioral expectations in Yoruba culture, particularly relating to women's roles in conflict situations.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A woman does not pay for/settle the herbs/medicine of a fight.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eccl\u1ecdgb\u1ecd\u0301n kan \u00f2 ta k\u00f3k\u00f3 omi s\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd; \u1ecd\u0300m\u1ecd\u0300r\u00e0n kan \u00f2 m\u1ecd oye er\u00f9p\u1eb9\u0300 il\u1eb9\u0300.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

When connected to our target proverb, it suggests that staying away from certain situations (like paying for fight medicine) is a matter of wisdom and discretion.\n\nInterim Insight: The target proverb likely advises that women should exercise wisdom by avoiding involvement in the aftermath of conflicts, suggesting both cultural gender norms and practical wisdom about avoiding unnecessary trouble.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A woman does not pay for the medicinal herbs used after a fight.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb advises that women should not be responsible for dealing with the consequences of conflicts they didn't initiate. It reflects traditional gender roles in Yoruba society where certain responsibilities, particularly those relating to physical confrontations and their aftermath, were considered men's domain. The proverb can be understood as both descriptive (reflecting cultural norms) and prescriptive (advising women to avoid getting entangled in others' conflicts). In a broader sense, it counsels discretion about which problems one takes responsibility for solving.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 establishes gender role context, while Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the wisdom of knowing which situations to avoid.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"Ol\u00f3b\u00ecnrin kan k\u00ec \u00ed pagbo \u00ecja\" translates to \"A woman does not pay for the medicinal herbs used after a fight.\" This proverb advises women not to take responsibility for conflicts they didn't start and reflects traditional Yoruba gender norms. Beyond its gendered context, it contains universal wisdom about discretion and not shouldering the consequences of others' disputes."
