  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the words in the proverb:\n- \"\u00c0gb\u00e0\" = elder, older person\n- \"t\u00ed\" = who, that\n- \"k\u00f2\" = does not, doesn't\n- \"l\u1eb9\u0301s\u1eb9\u0300\" = have feet/legs\n- \"n\u00edl\u1eb9\u0300\" = on the ground\n- \"a\" = will, shall\n- \"l\u1ecd\u0301gb\u1ecd\u0301n\" = have wisdom\n- \"n\u00edn\u00fa\" = inside, within\n\nPutting it together literally: \"An elder who doesn't have feet/legs on the ground will have wisdom inside.\"\n\nNow, let me interpret the meaning:\nThis proverb uses a metaphorical contrast. It suggests that even if an elder is physically limited (cannot walk or move around easily), they compensate with inner wisdom. It emphasizes that physical limitations don't diminish one's intellectual capacity or wisdom gained through experience.\n\nThe English translation would be:\n\"An elder who cannot stand may still be rich in wisdom.\"\n\nThis proverb teaches that we shouldn't judge people by their physical abilities but rather recognize that wisdom and intelligence can exist regardless of physical limitations."
