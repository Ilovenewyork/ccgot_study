  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"One cannot be wiser than the person for whom one is consulting the oracle.\"\n\nThe proverb uses the context of If\u00e1 divination (consulting the oracle) to convey the wisdom that you shouldn't presume to know better than someone whose future or situation you're merely interpreting or advising on. It suggests humility when giving counsel to others, recognizing that each person ultimately knows their own circumstances best."
