  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\n1) Breaking down the components:\n   - \"\u1eb8y\u1eb9\" means \"bird\"\n   - \"\u00f2 l\u00e8\" means \"cannot\"\n   - \"r\u00ed\" means \"see\" or \"find\"\n   - \"omi in\u00fa \u00e0gb\u1ecdn\" means \"water inside a coconut\"\n   - \"b\u00f9 mu\" means \"to scoop and drink\"\n\n2) Putting it together literally:\n   \"A bird cannot see/find the water inside a coconut to drink.\"\n\n3) Understanding the meaning:\n   This proverb speaks to the inaccessibility of something valuable. The water inside a coconut is refreshing and nutritious, but a bird cannot access it because the coconut shell is hard and closed.\n\n4) English translation:\n   \"A bird cannot drink the water inside a coconut.\"\n\nThis proverb metaphorically conveys that some resources or opportunities, though they exist, may be inaccessible to certain individuals due to natural limitations or barriers."
