  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Translation:** \"The fashionable person enters the market walking proudly/majestically, the dirty/unkempt person enters the market walking slowly/carefully; it is the dirty person who ends up carrying the fashionable person's load home.\"\n\n**Explanation:** \nThis proverb highlights the contrast between appearance and actual usefulness or functionality. The \"af\u00ednj\u00fa\" (fashionable or elegant person) makes a grand entrance with an impressive gait (\"gb\u1eb9nd\u1eb9\u0301k\u1eb9\" - walking majestically), focused on looking good and being noticed. Meanwhile, the \"\u1ecd\u0300b\u00fan\" (dirty or unkempt person) enters modestly and quietly (\"\u1e63\u00f9\u1eb9\u0300\u1e63\u00f9\u1eb9\u0300\" - slowly/carefully).\n\nThe irony and lesson come in the second part: despite the fashionable person's grand display, it's the humble, unkempt person who provides the practical service of carrying the load. This proverb teaches that:\n\n1. Appearance can be deceiving\n2. Those who show off may not be the most useful or hardworking\n3. Sometimes the unassuming people are the ones who get the real work done\n4. Substance matters more than style\n\nIt's a caution against judging people's worth solely by their appearance or social status."
