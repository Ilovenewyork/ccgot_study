  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down by analyzing its components:\n\n1. \"A-bin\u00fa-f\u00f9f\u00f9\" - This refers to someone who gets angry quickly but whose anger also subsides quickly (literally \"one who gets angry like a gust of wind\")\n\n2. \"n\u00ed \u0144w\u00e1 o\u00fanj\u1eb9 f\u00fan\" - means \"is the one who looks for/provides food for\"\n\n3. \"a-bin\u00fa-w\u1eb9\u0301r\u1eb9\u0301-w\u1eb9\u0301r\u1eb9\u0301\" - This refers to someone whose anger builds slowly but lasts for a long time (literally \"one who gets angry slowly/steadily\")\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb translates to:\n\n\"The person who angers quickly (but calms quickly) provides food for the person who angers slowly (but stays angry).\"\n\nThe deeper meaning suggests that people with quick tempers who quickly forgive often end up serving or being taken advantage of by those who rarely get angry but hold grudges for a long time."
