  "gold": "Destitution does not attach to one at a particular place; suffering does not attack a person at a particular place; if one walks like a wretch into a town, if one looks like a loser when one enters a town, it is with a miserable calabash that the people will offer one water to drink.",
  "gen": "English translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"Poverty does not come from one place; suffering does not come from one place; if you walk in poverty, if you enter a town with the face of poverty, they will give you water to drink in a broken calabash.\"\n\nThis proverb conveys that poverty and suffering have many sources, and when one appears poor or destitute, they will be treated with disrespect (symbolized by being served water in a broken calabash rather than a proper vessel)."
