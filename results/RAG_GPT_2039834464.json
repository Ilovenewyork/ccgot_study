  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"E\u0323l\u00e9\u0323\u00e8\u0323\u00e9\u0323d\u00e9\u0323 \u0144l\u1ecd \u00e8\u0323\u00e9\u0323d\u00e9\u0323, o n\u00ed \u201c\u00c8\u0323\u00e9\u0323d\u00e9\u0323gb\u00e8\u0323ta ni \u00e0b\u00ed \u00e8\u0323\u00e9\u0323d\u00e9\u0323gb\u00e8\u0323f\u00e0?\u201d; \u00e8wo lo gb\u00e9 n\u00edb\u00e8\u0323?\" can be translated to English as: \"The pig owner is going to the pig market, and you ask, 'Is it three hundred pigs or six hundred pigs?' Which one do you have there?\"\n\nThis proverb is used to highlight the absurdity or irrelevance of asking unnecessary questions when the answer is either obvious or irrelevant to the situation. It suggests that one should focus on what is present or available rather than speculating or asking about things that are not pertinent. In essence, it advises against overthinking or complicating matters with unnecessary inquiries."
