  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb into English step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the proverb into its two parts:\n1. \"A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00e1 \u1e63\u00ecw\u00ed\"\n2. \"A k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00f2 s\u00f9n-\u00f9n k\u00e1 d\u00e1r\u00e0n\"\n\nBreaking down the first part:\n- \"A k\u00ec \u00ed\" means \"One should not\" or \"We do not\"\n- \"d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301\" means \"keep quiet\" or \"remain silent\"\n- \"k\u00e1\" means \"and then\" or \"and yet\"\n- \"\u1e63\u00ecw\u00ed\" means \"speak wrongly\" or \"misspeak\"\n\nSo the first part means: \"One should not remain silent and yet be accused of speaking wrongly\"\n\nBreaking down the second part:\n- \"A k\u00ec \u00ed\" again means \"One should not\" or \"We do not\"\n- \"w\u00f2 s\u00f9n-\u00f9n\" means \"look on\" or \"be a mere spectator\"\n- \"k\u00e1\" means \"and then\" or \"and yet\"\n- \"d\u00e1r\u00e0n\" means \"be guilty\" or \"be found guilty of an offense\"\n\nSo the second part means: \"One should not be a mere spectator and yet be found guilty\"\n\nPutting it together in English:\n\"One should not be silent and be accused of speaking wrongly; one should not be a mere onlooker and be found guilty.\"\n\nThe essence of this proverb is about the importance of speaking up and taking action when necessary, as silence or inaction doesn't protect one from blame or accusation."
