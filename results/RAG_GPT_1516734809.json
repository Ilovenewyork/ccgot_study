  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"K\u00ec \u00ed d\u1ecdwo\u0301\u0323-\u1ecd baba k\u00f3 l\u00f3 di \u1ecdwo\u0301\u0323 \u1ecdm\u1ecd\" translates to \"It does not leave the hand of the father and enter the hand of the child\" in English.\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb emphasizes the idea of continuity and the natural progression of inheritance or responsibility from one generation to the next. It suggests that certain things, such as traits, responsibilities, or possessions, are passed down from parents to their children. The proverb implies that there is a natural order or process through which things are transferred from one generation to the next, and this process cannot be bypassed or altered. It highlights the importance of lineage, heritage, and the transmission of values or possessions within a family."
