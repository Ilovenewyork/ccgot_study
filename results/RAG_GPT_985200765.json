It suggests that when a person believes they know everything, they become closed off to learning and growth, which can lead to their downfall. The proverb serves as a caution against overconfidence and encourages humility and openness to new information and perspectives. It emphasizes the importance of continuous learning and the recognition that no one can truly know everything."
