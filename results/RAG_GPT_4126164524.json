  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0b\u00far\u00f2 r\u1eb9 \u0144d\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd f\u00fan \u1ecd, o n\u00ed o \u00f2 lo el\u00e9kuru; ta n\u00ed \u0144lo al\u00e1k\u00e0r\u00e0?\" can be translated to English as: \"Your younger sibling is making clothes for you, and you say you don't wear rags; who then wears patched clothes?\"\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis proverb is a commentary on ingratitude and the failure to appreciate the efforts of others, especially when they are doing their best to help or support you. In the context of the proverb, the younger sibling is making clothes, which is an act of kindness and support. However, the person dismisses this effort by saying they don't wear rags, implying that the clothes made by the sibling are not good enough. The rhetorical question \"who then wears patched clothes?\" highlights the irony and ungratefulness of the situation, suggesting that if you cannot appreciate the effort of someone close to you, then who else will you appreciate?\n\nThe proverb teaches the importance of gratitude and recognizing the value in the efforts and contributions of others, even if they do not meet one's personal standards or expectations."
