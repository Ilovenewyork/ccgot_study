  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"Ibi t\u00ed a ti \u0144p\u00ect\u00e0n k\u00e1 t\u00f3 jog\u00fan, k\u00e1 mo\u0300\u0323 p\u00e9 og\u00fan ib\u00e8\u0323 \u00f2 kanni\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\"Ibi t\u00ed a ti \u0144p\u00ect\u00e0n\"** - This part means \"The place where we are being told stories\" or \"The place where stories are being told.\"\n\n2. **\"k\u00e1 t\u00f3 jog\u00fan\"** - This translates to \"before we inherit\" or \"before we receive an inheritance.\"\n\n3. **\"k\u00e1 mo\u0300\u0323 p\u00e9\"** - This means \"we should know that\" or \"let us know that.\"\n\n4. **\"og\u00fan ib\u00e8\u0323 \u00f2 kanni\"** - This translates to \"the inheritance there is not ours\" or \"the inheritance there does not concern us.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated into English as:\n\"Before we inherit from the place where stories are being told, let us know that the inheritance there is not ours.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests the importance of understanding the context and relevance of what is being passed down to us, implying that not everything shared or inherited is necessarily applicable or beneficial to us."
