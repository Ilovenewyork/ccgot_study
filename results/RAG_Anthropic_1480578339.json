Palm oil is an important cooking ingredient in Yoruba cuisine, primarily used in making soup. The proverb describes a child who has never seen soup (the proper use of palm oil) yet uses the precious palm oil merely to rub on their chest (a wasteful misuse).\n\nThe proverb is used to criticize people who misapply valuable resources or opportunities because they lack understanding or experience. It's similar to the English expression \"pearls before swine,\" suggesting that giving valuable things to those who don't appreciate their worth leads to waste or misuse.\n\nThis saying is often applied to situations where someone lacks the experience or knowledge to properly value or utilize what they have been given."
