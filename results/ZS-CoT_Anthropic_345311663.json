  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down word by word, then construct the full meaning.\n\nStep 1: Identify the key words\n- \"\u1ecc\u0300y\u00e1j\u00fa\" refers to boldness, impudence, or audacity\n- \"ba\u00e1l\u00e9\" means \"head of household\" or \"landlord\"\n- \"n\u00ed \u0144p\u00e0d\u00e9\" means \"meets\" or \"encounters\"\n- \"\u00ecb\u00f2s\u00ed\" refers to insult or disrespect\n- \"l\u1ecd\u0301n\u00e0\" means \"on the way\" or \"on the road\"\n\nStep 2: Construct the literal translation\n\"The impudence/audacity of the landlord meets with insult on the road.\"\n\nStep 3: Interpret the meaning\nThis proverb suggests that when someone in a position of authority (the landlord) acts with excessive boldness or arrogance, they will inevitably encounter disrespect or resistance from others.\n\nStep 4: Provide an equivalent English expression\n\"The arrogant master will meet disrespect on his path.\"\n\nIn broader terms, this proverb teaches that pride or arrogance, even from those in power, often leads to humiliation or disrespect. It's similar to the English saying \"Pride comes before a fall.\""
