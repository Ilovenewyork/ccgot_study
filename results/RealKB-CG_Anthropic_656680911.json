This similar phrase speaks about shame and consequences of behavior affecting not just the individual but their community.\n2. It suggests a social responsibility where one's actions reflect on others and have wider consequences.\n3. The phrase emphasizes how ignoring social norms leads to negative outcomes.\n4. There's an element of hierarchy and respect implied - when expected behaviors aren't followed, social disorder results.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase indicates that the main proverb likely deals with proper social conduct, especially regarding respect for established social hierarchies and the consequences of failing to observe them.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"An elder who refuses to greet the king is tying a rope around himself.\" (Or more directly: \"An elder who doesn't greet the Aare is using a rope to bury himself.\")\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \"\u1ecc\u0300k\u00e1nj\u00faw\u00e0 \u00e0gb\u00e0 n\u00ed \u0144s\u1ecd ara \u1eb9\u0300 d\u00e8we.\" (It is a stubborn elder who reduces himself to the status of a child.)\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase discusses how an elder's inappropriate behavior can diminish their own status.\n2. It points to the Yoruba concept that wisdom and proper conduct are expected to increase with age.\n3. When elders act inappropriately, they undermine their own position in society.\n4. This relates strongly to the main proverb - both involve elders failing to act according to their status.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase clarifies that the main proverb is specifically about how elders who don't observe proper protocols (like greeting authority figures) are actively harming their own standing and bringing consequences upon themselves.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"An elder who refuses to greet the king is preparing for his own funeral.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb teaches about the importance of showing proper respect to authority figures in Yoruba culture. The \"Aare\" is a title for a high chief or king, and greeting elders and authority figures is a fundamental aspect of Yoruba social etiquette. When an elder refuses to show this basic respect, they are metaphorically preparing for their own demise - both socially and potentially literally. The proverb highlights how pride and refusal to acknowledge established hierarchies leads to self-destruction. In Yoruba society, such behavior would lead to social isolation and loss of status, effectively a form of social death.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase demonstrates how improper behavior brings shame, while the second clarifies how elders are especially expected to model proper conduct, and failure to do so diminishes their status to that of immature individuals.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 t\u00ed \u00f2 k\u00ed \u00c0\u00e0r\u1eb9 \u0144fi ok\u00f9n sin ara-a r\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"An elder who refuses to greet the king is preparing for his own funeral.\" It emphasizes that refusing to show proper respect to authority figures, especially when you yourself hold elevated status as an elder, is self-destructive. In Yoruba culture, this represents a serious breach of social norms that would result in loss of status and social standing - a metaphorical death within the community."
