  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"A-d\u00e1-m\u00e1-l\u00e8-\u1e63e \u00e0d\u00e0b\u00e0 t\u00ed \u0144d\u00fan b\u00e8\u0323m\u0300b\u00e8\u0323\" can be translated to English as \"One who claims to be gentle like a dove but makes a loud noise.\"\n\n### Explanation:\nThis proverb is used to describe someone who pretends to be gentle, calm, or harmless but whose actions or behavior contradict that appearance. The dove is often associated with peace and gentleness, and the sound \"b\u00e8\u0323m\u0300b\u00e8\u0323\" suggests a loud or disruptive noise, which is not characteristic of a dove. Therefore, the proverb highlights the inconsistency between one's claimed nature and their actual behavior, often pointing to hypocrisy or deceit. It serves as a caution against trusting appearances without considering actions."
