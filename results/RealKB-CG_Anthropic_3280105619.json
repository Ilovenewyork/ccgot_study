  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00c0p\u00e1r\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1, \u00ecj\u00e0 n\u00ed \u0144d\u00e0.\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u00c0p\u00e1r\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1 ni in\u00e1 \u0144d\u00e1; in\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u00e8 r\u00ed omi gb\u00e9\u1e63e.\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00c0p\u00e1r\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1 ni in\u00e1 \u0144d\u00e1; in\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u00e8 r\u00ed omi gb\u00e9\u1e63e\" translates roughly to \"A large slap creates fire; fire cannot see water to avoid it.\"\n2. This suggests that \"\u00e0p\u00e1r\u00e1\" refers to a slap or confrontation, and there's a connection between a big slap and creating fire or conflict.\n3. The second part implies that once a conflict starts, it cannot easily be controlled or stopped (like fire cannot avoid water).\n4. There appears to be a cause-and-effect relationship between \"\u00e0p\u00e1r\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1\" (a big slap) and something that follows.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely deals with how provocative actions lead to inevitable conflicts or consequences that cannot be easily controlled once set in motion.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A big slap creates a fight\" or \"A great slap leads to conflict.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1ecc\u0300y\u00e1j\u00fa-u ba\u00e1l\u00e9 n\u00ed \u0144p\u00e0d\u00e9 \u00ecb\u00f2s\u00ed l\u1ecd\u0301n\u00e0.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1ecc\u0300y\u00e1j\u00fa-u ba\u00e1l\u00e9 n\u00ed \u0144p\u00e0d\u00e9 \u00ecb\u00f2s\u00ed l\u1ecd\u0301n\u00e0\" roughly means \"The rashness/arrogance of the head of household is what meets disgrace on the way.\"\n2. This speaks to how pride, arrogance, or impulsive behavior leads to unfortunate consequences.\n3. Both proverbs share the theme of cause and effect, particularly how certain actions (slapping, arrogance) lead to predictable negative outcomes (fighting, disgrace).\n4. The cultural context suggests Yoruba wisdom about restraint and the natural consequences of provocative or disrespectful actions.\n\nInterim Insight: These proverbs teach about restraint and caution in behavior, warning that aggressive or disrespectful actions naturally provoke proportional responses or consequences.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A big slap inevitably leads to a fight.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that provocative actions will naturally lead to conflict. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the understanding of social harmony and the importance of measured responses. The proverb serves as a warning against initiating aggression or disrespect, as such actions will have predictable consequences. It embodies the Yoruba philosophy of cause and effect in social interactions and the natural order of justice where actions receive their due responses. It's both descriptive (explaining how conflicts start) and prescriptive (advising against provocative behavior).\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the cause-effect relationship between provocative actions and their consequences. Similar Phrase 2 adds the cultural dimension of how pride or arrogance leads to predictable negative outcomes.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0p\u00e1r\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1, \u00ecj\u00e0 n\u00ed \u0144d\u00e0\" translates to \"A big slap inevitably leads to a fight.\" It teaches that provocative actions naturally provoke responses in kind, warning against initiating conflict or disrespect. In Yoruba wisdom, this reflects understanding of social cause and effect - that one should not be surprised when aggressive actions result in proportional reactions. The proverb serves as both an explanation of human nature and guidance for maintaining social harmony through restrained behavior."
