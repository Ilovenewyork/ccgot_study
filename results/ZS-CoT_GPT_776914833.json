  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed fi \u00ecka ro et\u00ed, k\u00e1 fi ro im\u00fa, k\u00e1 w\u00e1 t\u00fan fi ta eh\u00edn\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **A k\u00ec \u00ed fi \u00ecka ro et\u00ed**: This part translates to \"One does not scratch the ear with a finger.\" It suggests that certain actions or methods are inappropriate or not suitable for certain tasks.\n\n2. **k\u00e1 fi ro im\u00fa**: This translates to \"and then use it to scratch the nose.\" It continues the idea of using a finger inappropriately for another task.\n\n3. **k\u00e1 w\u00e1 t\u00fan fi ta eh\u00edn**: This means \"and then use it to pick the teeth.\" It completes the sequence of using a finger inappropriately for various tasks.\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as: \"One does not scratch the ear with a finger, then use it to scratch the nose, and then use it to pick the teeth.\"\n\nThe underlying message of this proverb is about the importance of using appropriate methods or tools for specific tasks and maintaining hygiene or propriety in actions."
