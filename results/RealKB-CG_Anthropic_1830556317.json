  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00c0-j\u1eb9-t\u00e1n, \u00e0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-m\u1ecdra, k\u00e1 fi \u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 m\u1eb9\u0301w\u1eb9\u0300\u1eb9\u0300w\u00e1 j\u1eb9un \u00f2 y\u1eb9 \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n.\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: K\u00f3-t\u00e1n-k\u00f3-t\u00e1n laj\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1 omi.\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"K\u00f3-t\u00e1n-k\u00f3-t\u00e1n laj\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1 omi\" translates roughly to \"It is with lapping that a dog drinks water to completion\" - referring to how a dog drinks water bit by bit with its tongue until finished.\n2. This suggests a methodology of doing things gradually but completely, implying patience and persistence in a natural process.\n3. This connects to our main proverb which appears to discuss eating manners or customs related to completion and proper conduct.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that there are proper ways to do things, even if they seem tedious or time-consuming. This adds context that our main proverb likely comments on proper eating etiquette that should be followed despite urgency or hunger.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"After eating to satisfaction, after eating without knowing oneself, using ten fingers to eat does not befit a human being.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: O k\u00f2 m\u1ecd \u1eb9\u0300w\u00e0 l\u00f3\u0144j\u1eb9 \u00e0-j\u1eb9-s\u00f9n.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The phrase \"O k\u00f2 m\u1ecd \u1eb9\u0300w\u00e0 l\u00f3\u0144j\u1eb9 \u00e0-j\u1eb9-s\u00f9n\" roughly translates to \"You don't know beauty while eating the eat-and-sleep meal\" - referring to someone who eats hastily without appreciation or manners.\n2. This reinforces the idea of mindful eating versus mindless consumption, suggesting cultural values of self-control and proper decorum even when satisfying basic needs.\n3. The phrase highlights how one's manner of eating reflects character and upbringing in Yoruba culture.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase emphasizes the cultural importance of eating with mindfulness and proper manners, which reinforces that our main proverb is a commentary on maintaining dignity and proper conduct even when very hungry.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Even when fully satiated, even when eating with abandon, using all ten fingers to eat is not befitting of a human being.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining proper etiquette and dignity regardless of circumstances. In Yoruba culture, eating with restraint and proper manners distinguishes humans from animals and demonstrates good upbringing and character. The proverb cautions against losing one's composure and civilized behavior even when extremely hungry or in informal settings. It teaches that while satisfying natural urges is necessary, how one does so reveals their true character and upbringing. This reflects the Yoruba emphasis on \u00ecw\u00e0 (character) and \u1eb9\u0300k\u1ecd\u0301 (training/education) as markers of a well-formed person.\n\n- References: The dog lapping water gradually (Similar Phrase 1) and the critique of mindless eating (Similar Phrase 2) both reinforce that there are proper ways to satisfy needs that preserve human dignity.\n\nFinal Answer: This Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0-j\u1eb9-t\u00e1n, \u00e0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-m\u1ecdra, k\u00e1 fi \u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 m\u1eb9\u0301w\u1eb9\u0300\u1eb9\u0300w\u00e1 j\u1eb9un \u00f2 y\u1eb9 \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n\" teaches that even when extremely hungry or eating abundantly, using all ten fingers (eating greedily or messily) is undignified and unbecoming of a proper human being. It emphasizes that maintaining proper manners and self-control, especially during eating, is a fundamental aspect of humanity and good character in Yoruba culture."
