  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u1eb8\u0300w\u1ecd\u0300n t\u00f3 t\u00f3 \u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9 \u00f2 t\u00f3-\u00f3 d\u00e1 erin d\u00far\u00f3; \u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00ed erin m\u00e1 r\u00f2k\u00e8 \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n, t\u00f2un terin n\u00ed \u0144l\u1ecd.\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u00cct\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 t\u00f3 \u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9 k\u00f2 t\u00f3 p\u00e9 k\u00e9rin m\u00e1 l\u1ecd; \u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 p\u00e9 k\u00e9rin m\u00e1 l\u1ecd \u00c0l\u1ecd\u0301, t\u00f2un terin n\u00ed \u0144l\u1ecd.\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. Both phrases involve similar imagery: \"\u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n\" (rope/vine), \"\u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9\" (palm tree), and \"erin\" (elephant).\n2. The first phrase suggests that a rope as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant from proceeding.\n3. Both phrases contain the parallel structure where the rope/chain that is supposed to restrain the elephant ends up going along with the elephant.\n4. This suggests a power dynamic - the elephant (representing great strength) cannot be restrained by something relatively insignificant.\n\nInterim Insight: This appears to be a Yoruba proverb about the futility of weak restraints against powerful forces. The image of a rope or chain that ends up going along with the elephant rather than restraining it creates a powerful visual metaphor.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A chain as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant; the rope that says the elephant should not climb the \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n tree, both the rope and the elephant are going together.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A \u00f2 m\u1ecd ohun t\u00ed D\u00e1r\u00f2-\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f3 t\u00f3 w\u00ed p\u00e9 ol\u00e8-\u00e9 k\u00f3 \u00f2un.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second phrase translates roughly to \"We don't know what Daro had before claiming he was robbed.\"\n2. This introduces a skeptical perspective about claims made without evidence.\n3. This adds an additional layer to our proverb: not only is the restraint ineffective, but the attempt to control the situation leads to a different outcome than intended.\n4. Both phrases deal with situations where expected control or authority fails.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the theme of powerlessness in the face of greater forces, and suggests that claims of control or authority should be viewed skeptically when actual power is lacking.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A chain as tall as a palm tree cannot stop an elephant; the rope that forbids the elephant from climbing the \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n tree ends up going along with the elephant.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the futility of weak constraints against powerful forces. In Yoruba culture, the elephant symbolizes tremendous strength and unstoppable force. The proverb teaches that attempting to control something or someone with insufficient means is not only futile but may result in the would-be controller being carried along by the force they sought to restrain. It warns against overestimating one's authority or influence and serves as a reminder that real power cannot be contained by symbolic or inadequate restraints. The proverb might be applied to situations where institutional rules, social conventions, or individual commands lack the genuine authority or power needed to be effective.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the imagery of the ineffective restraint, while Similar Phrase 2 adds the dimension of skepticism toward claims of control or authority without sufficient backing.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8\u0300w\u1ecd\u0300n t\u00f3 t\u00f3 \u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9 \u00f2 t\u00f3-\u00f3 d\u00e1 erin d\u00far\u00f3; \u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00ed erin m\u00e1 r\u00f2k\u00e8 \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n, t\u00f2un terin n\u00ed \u0144l\u1ecd\" translates to \"A chain as tall as a palm tree cannot"
