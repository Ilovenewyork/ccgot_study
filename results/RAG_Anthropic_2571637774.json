It suggests that an elder who may be physically weak, immobile, or unable to stand firmly (\"doesn't have a foothold on the ground\") compensates with inner wisdom or intelligence.\n\nThe proverb acknowledges that as people age and lose physical strength, they often gain wisdom through their accumulated life experiences. It recognizes that value comes in different forms - while the elder may not contribute physical labor, their wisdom and guidance are equally important contributions to society.\n\nThis reflects the Yoruba cultural respect for elders as repositories of knowledge and wisdom, even when their physical capabilities diminish with age."
