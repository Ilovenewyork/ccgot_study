  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"K\u00ed ni wo\u0301\u0323n ti \u0144\u1e63e \u00c0mo\u0301\u0323d\u00f9 n\u00cdl\u1ecdrin? Ew\u00far\u00e9\u0323 \u0144j\u00e9\u0323 b\u00e9\u0323\u00e8\u0323.\" translates to \"What are they doing to \u00c0m\u1ecdd\u00f9 in Ilorin? A goat is eating it like that.\"\n\nThis proverb is used to describe a situation where something is happening that seems unusual or unexpected, but it is actually quite normal or typical for the context. The mention of \u00c0m\u1ecdd\u00f9 and Ilorin, along with the goat eating, suggests that what might seem strange or noteworthy to an outsider is actually a common occurrence in that setting. Essentially, it highlights the idea that what might be perceived as odd or noteworthy is just the usual way of things in that particular environment."
