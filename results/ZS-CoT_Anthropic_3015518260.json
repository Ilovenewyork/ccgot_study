  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down step by step:\n\n1) \"Al\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd-kan\" - This refers to \"a person with only one cloth/garment\" (al\u00e1 = owner of, a\u1e63\u1ecd = cloth/garment, kan = one)\n\n2) \"k\u00ec \u00ed\" - This is a negative marker meaning \"does not\" or \"never\"\n\n3) \"n\u00e1\" - This verb means \"to spend\" or \"to use lavishly\"\n\n4) \"\u00e0n\u00e1r\u1eb9\u0300\" - This refers to \"bleach\" or \"a bleaching agent\" used to whiten clothes\n\nPutting it all together, the literal translation is:\n\"A person with only one cloth/garment never uses bleach on it.\"\n\nThe English meaning/equivalent would be:\n\"A person with only one garment cannot afford to bleach it.\"\n\nThe deeper meaning of this proverb is about resource management - when you have limited resources, you can't afford to take risks with them or use them carelessly. It teaches prudence and careful management of what little one has."
