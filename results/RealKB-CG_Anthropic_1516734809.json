  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"K\u00ec \u00ed d\u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301-\u1ecd baba k\u00f3 l\u00f3 di \u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 \u1ecdm\u1ecd.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"B\u00ed \u1eccya \u0144k\u1ecd l\u1ecd\u0301run, b\u00ed \u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 \u0144j\u00f3 l\u00e1y\u00e9, k\u00f2 n\u00ed\u00ed bur\u00fa f\u00fan baba k\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f3 d\u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u00f2un l\u1ecd\u0301run\" references Yoruba deities \u1eccya and \u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 in relation to a father and child.\n2. It suggests that no matter what calamities occur (symbolized by \u1eccya sewing in heaven and \u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 dancing on earth), a father would not wish misfortune upon his child.\n3. This indicates a profound parent-child relationship in Yoruba culture where a parent prioritizes their child's welfare above all.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely concerns the protective relationship between parents and children, particularly emphasizing that troubles affecting a father should not transfer to his children.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"It should not move from father's hand to say it has become the child's hand/responsibility.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A \u00f2 m\u1ecd ohun t\u00ed D\u00e1r\u00f2-\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f3 t\u00f3 w\u00ed p\u00e9 ol\u00e8-\u00e9 k\u00f3 \u00f2un\" translates to \"We don't know what Daro had before claiming that a thief stole from him.\"\n2. This phrase suggests caution about blaming others when we might not have had anything to begin with.\n3. In relation to our proverb, it hints at the idea of responsibility and accountability - not transferring one's problems or failures to others, including one's children.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the notion that our proverb addresses inappropriate transfer of burdens or responsibilities, suggesting that parents should not shift their problems to their children.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A father's burden should not become his child's responsibility.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the ethical principle that parents should bear their own responsibilities and not transfer their burdens, problems, or obligations to their children. In Yoruba culture, while children are expected to respect and support their parents, parents have a primary duty to protect their children from unnecessary hardship. The proverb cautions against parents who might use their children as scapegoats or burden them with problems that rightfully belong to the parents. It reflects the Yoruba value of appropriate responsibility-bearing across generations and the protection of the younger generation from the mistakes or difficulties of their elders.\n\n- References: The similar phrases reinforce how deeply the Yoruba culture values proper intergenerational relationships and the protection of children from undue burdens, even when faced with significant challenges (as with \u1eccya and \u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3) or the temptation to displace blame (as in the Daro example).\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"K\u00ec \u00ed d\u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301-\u1ecd baba k\u00f3 l\u00f3 di \u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 \u1ecdm\u1ecd\" translates to \"A father's burden should not become his child's responsibility.\" It emphasizes that parents should not transfer their problems, failures, or obligations to their children. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of appropriate responsibility across generations and the ethical principle that elders should protect younger ones from unnecessary hardship rather than using them as outlets for their own difficulties."
