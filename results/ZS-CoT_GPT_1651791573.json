  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 ak\u00e0n t\u00f3 k\u00f3 s\u00ed garawa y\u00e8g\u00e8d\u00e8, oj\u00fa t\u00ec \u00ed\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 ak\u00e0n**: This phrase refers to an \"elderly crab.\" In Yoruba proverbs, animals are often used metaphorically to convey human traits or behaviors.\n\n2. **t\u00f3 k\u00f3 s\u00ed garawa y\u00e8g\u00e8d\u00e8**: \"T\u00f3 k\u00f3\" means \"that enters\" or \"that goes into.\" \"Garawa\" is a container, often a large bowl or basin. \"Y\u00e8g\u00e8d\u00e8\" implies something that is wide or spacious. So, this part of the proverb describes the crab entering a wide or spacious container.\n\n3. **oj\u00fa t\u00ec \u00ed**: \"Oj\u00fa t\u00ec\" means \"is ashamed\" or \"is embarrassed.\" The \"\u00ed\" at the end refers back to the subject, which is the crab.\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as: \"The elderly crab that enters a wide container is embarrassed.\"\n\nThis proverb metaphorically suggests that even those who are experienced or wise (like the elderly crab) can find themselves in situations where they feel out of place or embarrassed, especially when they overestimate their abilities or the situation."
