  "gen": "# Yoruba Proverb Translation & Explanation\n\nThe proverb \"\u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301d\u1eb9\u0300 \u00f2 m\u1eb9\u0300y\u1eb9\" translates to:\n\n**\"The pig does not know beauty/elegance.\"**\n\n**Literal translation:**\n- \u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301d\u1eb9\u0300 = pig\n- \u00f2 = does not\n- m\u1eb9\u0300y\u1eb9 = know beauty/elegance\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis proverb speaks to the idea that someone who lacks refinement or class cannot recognize or appreciate beauty or elegance. A pig, which typically wallows in mud and filth, has no concept of what it means to be beautiful or refined.\n\nThe proverb is used to describe someone who lacks taste or aesthetic sensibility, yet attempts to judge matters of beauty or elegance. It suggests that certain qualities can only be recognized by those who possess or understand those qualities themselves.\n\nThis connects to the similar proverb you listed: \"\u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301d\u1eb9\u0300 \u0144p\u00e0f\u1ecd\u0300, \u00f3 r\u00f2 p\u00e9 \u00f2\u00fan \u0144\u1e63oge\" which means \"A pig wallows in mud and thinks it's being fashionable\" - both highlight the disconnect between uncultured behavior and the understanding of refinement."
