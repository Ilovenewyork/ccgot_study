  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00d3 y\u1eb9 \u1eb9ni gbogbo k\u00f3 d\u00ednw\u00f3 ar\u00f3, k\u00f2 y\u1eb9 ato\u0300\u0323o\u0301\u0323l\u00e9\" translates to English as \"It is appropriate for everyone to show some restraint in mourning, but not for the one who has suffered the loss.\" This proverb suggests that while it is important for people to express sympathy and support, the depth of grief is most profound for the person directly affected by the loss."
