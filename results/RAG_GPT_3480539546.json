  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0-s\u00e9\u0323-k\u00fa l\u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 \u0144s\u00e9\u0323 o\u0300\u0323r\u00e0n\" can be translated to English as \"An elder handles matters with what is left undone.\" \n\nExplanation: This proverb emphasizes the wisdom and experience of elders in resolving issues. It suggests that an elder, with their accumulated knowledge and understanding, can address and manage problems effectively, even when it seems like there is little left to work with. The phrase \"\u00e0-s\u00e9\u0323-k\u00fa\" (what is left undone) implies that an elder can make the most out of limited resources or incomplete situations, using their insight to bring about resolution or improvement. It highlights the value of experience and the ability to navigate complex situations with what is available."
