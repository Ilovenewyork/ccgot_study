The similar phrase \"A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00e1 \u1e63\u00ecw\u00ed; a k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00f2 s\u00f9n-\u00f9n k\u00e1 d\u00e1r\u00e0n\" translates roughly to \"One does not keep silent and misspeak; one does not stare blankly and act wrongly.\" This suggests accountability in actions and speech.\n2. Both phrases use the structure \"k\u00ec \u00ed\" which indicates something that should not be done - a prohibition or improper action in Yoruba cultural context.\n3. The similar phrase emphasizes consciousness and intentionality in actions, suggesting our target proverb may also speak to deliberate action and responsibility.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with proper conduct, accountability, or the relationship between action and consequence.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.\nTranslation: \"One who beats the d\u00f9nd\u00fan drum cannot deny [playing] the music.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63er\u00e9e k\u00ed-l\u00f3-b\u00e1-y\u00ec\u00ed-w\u00e1?\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63er\u00e9e k\u00ed-l\u00f3-b\u00e1-y\u00ec\u00ed-w\u00e1?\" translates to \"An elder doesn't play the game of 'what brought this about?'\" meaning elders should take responsibility rather than feigning ignorance about consequences.\n2. This reinforces the theme of accountability present in our target proverb - just as elders should own their actions, so too should drummers acknowledge the music they create.\n3. The d\u00f9nd\u00fan is a talking drum in Yoruba culture that \"speaks\" the Yoruba tonal language, so the drummer has direct agency and responsibility for the \"words\" produced.\n\nInterim Insight: The cultural significance of the d\u00f9nd\u00fan as a communication tool adds depth to the proverb - it's not just about music but about communication, expression, and taking ownership of one's words and actions.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One who beats the d\u00f9nd\u00fan drum cannot deny [responsibility for] the music [it produces].\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes personal accountability for one's actions and their consequences. In Yoruba culture, the d\u00f9nd\u00fan is not merely a musical instrument but a communication tool that \"speaks\" through its tones. The drummer deliberately creates specific sounds, so claiming no responsibility for what emerges would be absurd. The proverb teaches that we must own the consequences of our deliberate actions, just as a drummer must acknowledge the music they create. It applies broadly to situations where people attempt to distance themselves from the natural outcomes of their own actions.\n- References: The accountability theme in \"A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00e1 \u1e63\u00ecw\u00ed; a k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00f2 s\u00f9n-\u00f9n k\u00e1 d\u00e1r\u00e0n\" and the elder's responsibility in \"\u00c0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63er\u00e9e k\u00ed-l\u00f3-b\u00e1-y\u00ec\u00ed-w\u00e1?\" both reinforce the cultural value of owning one's actions and their consequences.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"A-lu-d\u00f9nd\u00fan k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1rin\" translates to \"One who beats the d\u00f9nd\u00fan drum cannot deny responsibility for the music it produces.\" It teaches that we must take responsibility for our actions and their consequences. In Yoruba culture, where the talking drum literally \"speaks\" through the drummer's skill, this imagery powerfully conveys that we cannot separate ourselves from what we deliberately create or cause. This wisdom applies whenever someone tries to disown the predictable outcomes of their own choices."
