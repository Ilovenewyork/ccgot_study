In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb teaches about self-awareness and the inevitability of confronting one's own reality.\n\nThe proverb functions on multiple levels:\n- At a basic level, it states a physical truth - when you lower your eyes, you can indeed see your nose\n- At a deeper level, it suggests that introspection leads to self-knowledge\n- It implies that when you humble yourself and pay attention, you will discover things about yourself that were always there\n\nThe proverb encourages humility, self-examination, and acknowledgment of one's own traits or circumstances before looking outward to judge others."
