  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"A-d\u00e1-m\u00e1-l\u00e8-\u1e63e \u00e0d\u00e0b\u00e0 t\u00ed \u0144d\u00fan b\u00e8\u0323m\u0300b\u00e8\u0323\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **A-d\u00e1-m\u00e1-l\u00e8-\u1e63e**: This phrase can be understood as \"one who claims to be innocent\" or \"one who pretends to be harmless.\"\n\n2. **\u00e0d\u00e0b\u00e0**: This word means \"dove\" in Yoruba. Doves are often symbols of peace and innocence.\n\n3. **t\u00ed \u0144d\u00fan b\u00e8\u0323m\u0300b\u00e8\u0323**: This part of the proverb describes the action of making a sound, specifically \"b\u00e8\u0323m\u0300b\u00e8\u0323,\" which can be interpreted as a loud or noticeable noise.\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated to: \"The one who claims to be as innocent as a dove makes a loud noise.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that someone who pretends to be innocent or harmless may actually be drawing attention to themselves through their actions, indicating that they might not be as innocent as they claim."
