The proverb uses the imagery of a hard slap (\u00e0p\u00e1r\u00e1 \u0144l\u00e1) that, because of its severity, will naturally provoke retaliation and lead to a full-blown fight (\u00ecj\u00e0).\n\nThe wisdom in this proverb lies in its counsel for moderation and appropriate response. It suggests that extreme actions or overreactions often trigger equally strong or even stronger counteractions. This applies to various contexts - from interpersonal relationships to community disputes and even international relations.\n\nThe proverb serves as a caution against excessive force or harshness, advising that proportionate responses help prevent unnecessary escalation of conflicts."
