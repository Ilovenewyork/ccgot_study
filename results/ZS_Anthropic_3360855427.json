  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"One does not worship a deity during the harmattan season; when the rainy season arrives, the altar will be rebuilt.\"\n\nThis proverb speaks to the idea of timing and consistency in commitment. It suggests that true devotion isn't just shown during difficult times (represented by the dry harmattan season) but should be maintained consistently. When better times come (the rainy season), proper respect and rituals can be restored. The proverb criticizes fair-weather worship or relationships that only appear when convenient."
