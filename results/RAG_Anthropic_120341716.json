  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:**\n\"A wife who beats her stepchild is looking for something to hear (or wants to hear words).\"\n\n**Meaning:**\nThis proverb refers to a situation where a stepmother mistreats her stepchild. It suggests that when a wife or stepmother beats or mistreats her stepchild, she is essentially inviting confrontation or criticism from her husband (the child's father) or other family members.\n\n**Cultural context:**\nIn traditional Yoruba society, family structures often included polygamous households where children might be raised by stepmothers. The proverb acknowledges the sometimes tense dynamics in such relationships while warning against mistreatment of stepchildren.\n\n**Broader application:**\nBeyond the literal family context, this proverb can be applied to any situation where someone mistreats someone under their care who is closely connected to others with authority. It suggests that such behavior will inevitably provoke a response or confrontation.\n\nThe proverb serves as a warning that actions have consequences, particularly when those actions involve mistreating vulnerable individuals who have protectors."
