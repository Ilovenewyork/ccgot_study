  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb by breaking it down into parts:\n\nThe proverb consists of three parallel phrases with the same structure:\n1. \"\u00c0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-k\u00far\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144pa \u1eb9m\u1ecd\u0301n\"\n2. \"\u00c0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-k\u00far\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144pa \u00e0f\u00e8\"\n3. \"\u00c0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-k\u00far\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144pa m\u00e1l\u00e1\u00e0j\u00fa\"\n\nBreaking down the structure:\n- \"\u00c0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-k\u00far\u00f2\" seems to refer to \"refusing to leave\" or \"persistence in staying\"\n- \"n\u00ed \u0144pa\" means \"is what kills\" or \"is what destroys\"\n- The last word in each phrase refers to different things:\n  * \"\u1eb9m\u1ecd\u0301n\" refers to a mosquito\n  * \"\u00e0f\u00e8\" refers to a housefly\n  * \"m\u00e1l\u00e1\u00e0j\u00fa\" refers to a housefly with reddish eyes\n\nSo the literal translation would be:\n\"Refusing to leave is what kills the mosquito; refusing to leave is what kills the housefly; refusing to leave is what kills the red-eyed fly.\"\n\nThe meaning behind this proverb:\nThis proverb teaches about the danger of overstaying one's welcome or persisting in a situation beyond appropriate time. Just as insects get killed when they linger too long in one place (often getting swatted), people who don't know when to leave or withdraw from situations may face negative consequences.\n\nEnglish translation:\n\"Knowing when to leave is what saves one from destruction.\""
