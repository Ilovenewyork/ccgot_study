  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down and analyze its components:\n\n\"Ta n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9un t\u00e1j\u00e1 \u0144j\u00f9r\u00f9?\"\n\nBreaking it down:\n- \"Ta n\u00ed\" = \"Who is\" or \"Who's the one\"\n- \"\u0144j\u1eb9un\" = \"eating food\" (\u0144 = present continuous marker, j\u1eb9un = to eat food)\n- \"t\u00e1\" = \"that\" or \"while\"\n- \"j\u00e1\" = \"dog\"\n- \"\u0144j\u00f9r\u00f9\" = \"is watching\" or \"is staring\" (again \u0144 marks continuous action)\n\nPutting it together literally: \"Who is eating food while the dog is staring/watching?\"\n\nThe meaning of this proverb speaks to the awkwardness or impropriety of enjoying something in the presence of someone who lacks it or desires it. It highlights the discomfort of consuming resources while someone in need looks on.\n\nEnglish equivalent translation:\n\"Who can eat comfortably while a hungry dog watches?\"\n\nThis proverb teaches about compassion, sharing, and being mindful of others' needs when you have plenty."
