The \"aaka\" (a type of bird) does not live in the savannah (\"o\u0300\u0323d\u00e0n\") but in the forest (\"igb\u00f3\"), indicating that it is out of place in the savannah.\n2. This imagery can be related to the idea of being in a situation or environment that is not suitable or natural, leading to potential negative outcomes.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb \"\u00d2\u0323y\u00e1j\u00fa-u ba\u00e1l\u00e9 n\u00ed \u0144p\u00e0d\u00e9 \u00ecb\u00f2s\u00ed lo\u0301\u0323n\u00e0\" may involve the concept of being out of one's natural or appropriate role or place, leading to undesirable consequences.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation**  \n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.  \nTranslation: \"The disrespectful head of a household meets disgrace on the way.\"\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection**  \nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0gb\u00e0-\u00ecy\u00e0 t\u00ed \u0144m\u00f9k\u1ecd o\u0300\u0323n\u00edn\u00ed, \u00f3 n\u00ed n\u00edtor\u00ed omi gb\u00edgb\u00f3n\u00e1 or\u00ed-i r\u00e8\u0323 ni.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2**  \n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.  \nChain-of-Thought:  \n1.

This suggests a theme of accountability and the tendency to deflect blame rather than accept responsibility for one's actions.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb \"\u00d2\u0323y\u00e1j\u00fa-u ba\u00e1l\u00e9 n\u00ed \u0144p\u00e0d\u00e9 \u00ecb\u00f2s\u00ed lo\u0301\u0323n\u00e0\" emphasizes the consequences of one's actions, particularly when one fails to fulfill their role or responsibilities, leading to disgrace or failure.\n\n**Final Synthesis:**  \n- Final Translation: \""
