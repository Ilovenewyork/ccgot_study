  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Oj\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed po\u0301\u0323n ba\u00e1l\u00e9 il\u00e9 k\u00f3 f\u1ecdwo\u0301\u0323 gb\u00e1l\u00e8\u0323 il\u00e9 \u00e8\u0323\" translates to \"The head of a household does not become so blind that he sweeps his own house with his hands.\"\n\nThis proverb conveys the idea that a person in a position of authority or responsibility should not be reduced to performing tasks that are beneath their status or role. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining one's dignity and the proper delegation of duties. In a broader sense, it suggests that people should not be forced into situations that compromise their position or respect within a community or family."
