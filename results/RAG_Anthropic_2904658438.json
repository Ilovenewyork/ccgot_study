It highlights how people often worry about others who may actually be content or have accepted their situation.\n\nThe proverb teaches that we shouldn't be more troubled about someone's problems than they are themselves. It can apply to situations where:\n\n1. People unnecessarily worry about others who have adapted to their circumstances\n2. Someone shows resilience in the face of adversity while others pity them\n3. Outsiders misunderstand someone's situation and assume it's worse than it actually is\n\nIn Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to caution against excessive worry or meddling in others' affairs when they themselves seem at peace with their situation."
