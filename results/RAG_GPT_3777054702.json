  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"E\u0323y\u1eb9 \u00f2 l\u00e8 r\u00ed omi in\u00fa \u00e0gb\u1ecdn b\u00f9 mu\" translates to \"A bird cannot drink the water inside a coconut\" in English.\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb is used to convey the idea that certain things are beyond one's reach or capability, no matter how much one desires them. Just as a bird cannot access the water inside a coconut due to its hard shell, there are situations or goals that may be unattainable due to limitations or obstacles. It serves as a reminder to recognize and accept one's limitations and to focus on achievable goals."
