The image is vivid - a mature crab (representing an elder) crawling among bananas (an unfitting place) creates a sense of misplacement and impropriety.\n\nIn Yoruba culture, elders are expected to maintain dignity and serve as examples of proper conduct. When they engage in behavior unbecoming of their status or age, it brings shame not only to themselves but potentially to the community.\n\nThe proverb teaches that with age and status comes responsibility to behave appropriately. It serves as a warning that one's actions should align with one's position in society, especially as one grows older and more respected."
