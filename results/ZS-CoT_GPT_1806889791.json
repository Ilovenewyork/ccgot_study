  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed eegbo\u0301\u0323n b\u00e1 \u1e63o ay\u00ednr\u00edn n\u00edm\u00fa, ad\u00ec\u1eb9 ko\u0301\u0323 ni y\u00f3 ja\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **B\u00ed** - This means \"if\" in English.\n2. **eegbo\u0301\u0323n** - This refers to an \"elder sibling\" or \"elder\" in a general sense.\n3. **b\u00e1** - This is a verb that means \"does\" or \"performs an action.\"\n4. **\u1e63o** - This means \"to throw\" or \"to sprinkle.\"\n5. **ay\u00ednr\u00edn** - This means \"sand.\"\n6. **n\u00edm\u00fa** - This means \"in the nose\" or \"at the nose.\"\n7. **ad\u00ec\u1eb9** - This means \"chicken.\"\n8. **ko\u0301\u0323 ni y\u00f3 ja** - This phrase means \"will not fight\" or \"will not quarrel.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated to:\n\n\"If an elder sprinkles sand in the nose, the chicken will not fight.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that when someone in a position of authority or respect (like an elder) does something potentially provocative or challenging, those who are subordinate or less powerful (like the chicken) are expected not to retaliate or cause a disturbance. It emphasizes respect for authority and the idea that certain actions by respected individuals should not be met with resistance."
