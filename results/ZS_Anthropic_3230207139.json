  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed w\u1eb9w\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1n k\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 j\u1eb9 si\" translates to English as:\n\n\"An elder doesn't wash their hands and then say they will eat later.\"\n\nThe meaning of this proverb is that when an elder or respected person prepares for something (symbolized by washing hands before a meal), they should follow through immediately rather than delay. It teaches about decisiveness, commitment, and the importance of acting promptly when one has made preparations. In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to encourage people, especially those in positions of authority, to be decisive and not postpone important actions after they've already prepared for them."
