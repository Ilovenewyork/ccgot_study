  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"Mo m\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1n\" lOr\u00f2-\u00f3 fi \u0144gb\u00e9 \u1ecdk\u00f9nrin.\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: Mo d\u00e0gb\u00e0 mo d\u00e0g\u00f3, ar\u00e9 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 \u00f2 t\u00e1n l\u00f3j\u00fa\u00f9 mi.\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"Mo d\u00e0gb\u00e0 mo d\u00e0g\u00f3, ar\u00e9 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 \u00f2 t\u00e1n l\u00f3j\u00fa\u00f9 mi\" translates to \"I have grown old, but I haven't lost sight of childlike play/energy.\"\n2. This phrase speaks to the continuity of understanding or awareness despite changes in circumstances - even as one ages, they still understand or relate to youthful energy.\n3. The structure suggests a connection between knowledge/awareness and a subsequent action or state.\n\nInterim Insight: This suggests our proverb might deal with the relationship between knowledge/awareness and consequences, possibly implying that simply knowing something doesn't prevent consequences.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"I know it completely\" is how Oro (a deity/spirit) carries away a man.\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A s\u00ecnk\u00fa t\u00e1n, alugb\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u1ecd\u0301 \u00f3 f\u1eb9\u0301 \u1e63\u00fap\u00f3 ni?\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"A s\u00ecnk\u00fa t\u00e1n, alugb\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u1ecd\u0301 \u00f3 f\u1eb9\u0301 \u1e63\u00fap\u00f3 ni?\" translates roughly to \"After the burial is complete, the gravedigger doesn't leave - does he want to become a widow/widower?\"\n2. This phrase speaks to knowing when something is finished and when to depart - lingering after your role is complete can bring unexpected consequences.\n3. Both phrases contain \"t\u00e1n\" (completely/finished) and deal with consequences of actions or inaction.\n\nInterim Insight: This reinforces that our proverb warns about overconfidence in knowledge leading to downfall - just as the gravedigger who stays too long risks an unwanted outcome.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It is with 'I know it completely' that Oro carries away a man.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against overconfidence or presumed expertise. Oro is a powerful deity in Yoruba tradition associated with ancestral spirits and sometimes death. The proverb suggests that excessive confidence in one's knowledge (\"I know it completely\") often leads to downfall or destruction. It cautions against arrogance and reminds us that claiming complete knowledge of something dangerous can lead to serious consequences. Just as those who claim to fully understand Oro's mysteries might be the ones carried away by the deity, those who boast of complete mastery often fall victim to their own overconfidence.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase reminds us that awareness should be continuous and humble, while the second similar phrase reinforces the idea that knowing when something is complete (and respecting boundaries) is crucial for safety.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"Mo m\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1n\" lOr\u00f2-\u00f3 fi \u0144gb\u00e9 \u1ecdk\u00f9nrin means \"It is with 'I know it completely' that Oro carries away a man.\" This Yoruba wisdom warns against the dangers of overconfidence. In Yoruba culture, Oro is a powerful ancestral deity associated with mysteries and sometimes death. The proverb teaches that those who boast of complete knowledge or mastery are often the ones who suffer consequences. It's a caution against intellectual arrogance and a reminder that claiming to fully understand dangerous matters can lead to one's downfall. True wisdom includes acknowledging the limits of one's knowledge."
