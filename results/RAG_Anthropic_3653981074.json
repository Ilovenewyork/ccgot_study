It suggests that no matter how financially desperate the head of a household becomes, certain tasks beneath their status (like sweeping the ground with bare hands rather than using a proper broom) remain inappropriate for them.\n\nThe proverb emphasizes the cultural understanding of maintaining social hierarchy and appropriate roles even during hardship. It relates to the concept of dignity in leadership positions and the importance of maintaining one's position and respect in the community despite challenges.\n\nThe other proverbs you shared follow a similar pattern, suggesting that no matter how desperate a diviner becomes, they shouldn't ask about yesterday's sacrifice, and no matter how hungry a monkey gets, it shouldn't eat dirt."
