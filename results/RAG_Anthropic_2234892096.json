  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of \"Id\u00e0 ahun la fi \u0144pa ahun\"\n\n**Translation:**\n\"It is with the tortoise's sword that we kill the tortoise.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis Yoruba proverb means that a person's own weapons, tools, or methods can be used against them. It suggests that the very things we create or possess as strengths can become our weaknesses when they are turned against us. \n\nThe proverb uses the tortoise (ahun) as a metaphor - the tortoise is known for its protective shell and defensive qualities, yet the proverb suggests that even the tortoise's own defenses can be used to defeat it.\n\nIn practical terms, this wisdom applies when:\n- Someone's own words are used to contradict them\n- A person's tactics are studied and then used to outmaneuver them\n- The very tools one creates become instruments of their downfall\n- A person's strength, when overused, becomes a weakness\n\nThis proverb teaches us to be mindful that our own creations, methods, or characteristics can sometimes be turned against us."
