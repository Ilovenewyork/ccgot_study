  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n**Literal translation:** \"What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat is eating the same way.\"\n\n**Meaning:** This proverb points out that people often worry about others facing challenges in distant places while similar problems exist right in front of them. It highlights the irony of being concerned about someone else's situation when the same issue is happening in your own environment.\n\nThe proverb uses a rhetorical question about someone named Amodu in Ilorin (a Nigerian city), followed by pointing out that a goat nearby is experiencing the same treatment or situation. It teaches about the human tendency to focus on distant problems while ignoring similar issues closer to home.\n\nThis reflects the universal wisdom about people often being more interested in distant matters than addressing immediate concerns in their own surroundings - similar to the English saying \"The grass is always greener on the other side.\""
