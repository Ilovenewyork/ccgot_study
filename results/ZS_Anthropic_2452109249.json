  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"What animal have we not eaten before? The toad met us wearing shoes and it ruined everything.\"\n\nThe meaning is essentially about encountering something unusual or inappropriate that spoils an otherwise normal situation. It's used when someone who should know better behaves inappropriately or when something unexpected disrupts the normal order of things."
