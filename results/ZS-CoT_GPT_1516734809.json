  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"K\u00ec \u00ed d\u1ecdwo\u0301\u0323-\u1ecd baba k\u00f3 l\u00f3 di \u1ecdwo\u0301\u0323 \u1ecdm\u1ecd\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **K\u00ec \u00ed**: This phrase means \"it does not\" or \"it never.\"\n\n2. **d\u1ecdwo\u0301\u0323-\u1ecd**: This is a combination of \"d\u1ecd\" (to remain or stay) and \"owo\u0301\u0323\" (hand). Together, it implies \"remain in the hand of.\"\n\n3. **baba**: This means \"father.\"\n\n4. **k\u00f3**: This is a conjunction that means \"and\" or \"so that.\"\n\n5. **l\u00f3 di**: This means \"becomes\" or \"turns into.\"\n\n6. **\u1ecdwo\u0301\u0323**: Again, this means \"hand.\"\n\n7. **\u1ecdm\u1ecd**: This means \"child.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as: \"It never remains in the hand of the father and becomes the hand of the child.\"\n\nThe proverb suggests that certain responsibilities, traits, or possessions do not automatically transfer from one generation to the next without effort or intention. It emphasizes the idea that inheritance or legacy is not guaranteed and must be actively managed or earned."
