The structure parallels our main proverb in how it describes normative limitations - things don't act outside their expected parameters unless specifically prompted.\n3. Both proverbs use conditional statements to establish cultural boundaries and expectations.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests our main proverb likely deals with natural limitations or boundaries that define proper roles and expectations in Yoruba society.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Except for what is not sold in the market, a slave does not eat.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301\u1eb9\u0301f\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed l\u1ecd \u1eb9\u1eb9\u0301f\u00e0a r\u1eb9\u0300 k\u00e1 s\u1ecd p\u00e9 o di \u00ecj\u1eb9f\u00e0 t\u00ed a ti j\u1eb9un.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301\u1eb9\u0301f\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed l\u1ecd \u1eb9\u1eb9\u0301f\u00e0a r\u1eb9\u0300 k\u00e1 s\u1ecd p\u00e9 o di \u00ecj\u1eb9f\u00e0 t\u00ed a ti j\u1eb9un\" translates roughly to \"A person who owns six shouldn't lose their six and we say it's because it's six o'clock when we've eaten.\" This speaks to not making excuses for losses or circumstances beyond proper explanation.\n2. This proverb, like our main one, deals with social boundaries, proper justifications, and the limitations of what can be reasonably explained away.\n3. It reinforces the idea of social order and the inappropriateness of certain claims or behaviors.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase confirms our main proverb is about social boundaries and proper place - emphasizing that there are clear limits to what certain individuals can claim or access based on their social position.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Except for what is not sold in the market, a slave does not eat.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to social boundaries and status limitations in traditional society. It means that people of lower status (symbolized by slaves) should not have access to rare or forbidden items that even free people cannot obtain. More broadly, it teaches that everyone, regardless of position, must respect certain boundaries and limitations. In modern context, it reminds us that there are universal limitations that apply to everyone, and no one should expect special privileges beyond what is naturally available to all.\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce concepts of social boundaries, proper behavior within one's station, and the natural limitations that govern all members of society regardless of status.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe proverb \"\u00c0fi ohun t\u00ed a k\u00ec \u00ed t\u00e0 l\u1ecd\u0301j\u00e0 l\u1eb9r\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\" translates to \"Except for what is not sold in the market, a slave does not eat.\" This Yoruba wisdom teaches about social boundaries and universal limitations. It means that even those of lower status shouldn't expect access to things unavailable to everyone else. The proverb establishes that certain limitations apply universally - if something is so rare or forbidden that it's not even available in the marketplace for free people, then those of lower status certainly shouldn't expect access to it. In contemporary application, it reminds us that there are natural boundaries in life that apply to everyone, and we shouldn't expect special exceptions beyond what is reasonably available to all."
