  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\n1) Breaking down the proverb: \"B\u00ed eegb\u1ecd\u0301n b\u00e1 \u1e63o ay\u00ednr\u00edn n\u00edm\u00fa, ad\u00ec\u1eb9 k\u1ecd\u0301 ni y\u00f3 ja.\"\n\n2) Translating each component:\n   - \"B\u00ed eegb\u1ecd\u0301n b\u00e1\" = \"If an elder/older person\"\n   - \"\u1e63o ay\u00ednr\u00edn n\u00edm\u00fa\" = \"puts mucus/snot in their nose\"\n   - \"ad\u00ec\u1eb9 k\u1ecd\u0301 ni y\u00f3 ja\" = \"it is not a chicken that will fight it/remove it\"\n\n3) The literal translation is: \"If an elder puts mucus in their nose, it is not a chicken that will fight/remove it.\"\n\n4) Understanding the meaning: This proverb is about respecting hierarchy and knowing one's place. It suggests that when a superior person (elder) does something wrong or inappropriate, it's not the place of someone with lower status (symbolized by the chicken) to correct or challenge them.\n\n5) The English equivalent would be: \"If an elder puts mucus in their nose, it is not a chicken's place to challenge/confront them.\"\n\nThe proverb teaches about respecting authority structures while acknowledging that even those in authority can make mistakes, but it's important to know who has the standing to address those mistakes."
