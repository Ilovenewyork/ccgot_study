  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Ibi t\u00ed a fi ara s\u00ed lara \u0144gb\u00e9\" translates to \"Where one places oneself is where one will find comfort\" or \"Where one situates oneself is where one will dwell.\" \n\nThis proverb emphasizes the idea of personal responsibility and the consequences of one's choices. It suggests that the situations or conditions we find ourselves in are often a result of our own decisions and actions. Therefore, it encourages individuals to be mindful of the choices they make, as these choices will determine their experiences and comfort in life. It highlights the importance of being deliberate and thoughtful about where and how we position ourselves in various aspects of life, whether it be in relationships, career, or personal development."
