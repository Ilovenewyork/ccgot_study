  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translated to English means:\n\n\"The mosquito claims it can block the path; who would follow the path of a mosquito?\"\n\nThe proverb uses the imagery of a tiny mosquito boasting about blocking a path to illustrate the absurdity of someone insignificant making grand claims or threats. It's about people who overestimate their importance or power, when in reality they have little influence."
