  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb translates to English as: \"Greeting 'E\u0323 k\u00fa-ul\u00e9' is not necessary for those at home; 'E\u0323 k\u00fa at\u00ecb\u00e0' is not needed for someone who is running for cover; the person who does not greet others with 'K\u00fa at\u00ecb\u00e0' will miss out on 'E\u0323 k\u00fa-ul\u00e9.'\" \n\nThis proverb emphasizes the importance of appropriate greetings and the idea that failing to acknowledge others in the right way can lead to missed opportunities for connection or support."
