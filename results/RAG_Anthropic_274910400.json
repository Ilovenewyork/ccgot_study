The phrase \"\u1eb9l\u1eb9\u0301w\u00e0a \u1e62\u00e0p\u1ecd\u0301n\" refers to a beautiful person from \u1e62\u00e0p\u1ecd\u0301n (a place name).\n\nThe proverb is used in contexts where someone is being encouraged to proceed with what they know how to do best, rather than attempting something unfamiliar or beyond their expertise. It acknowledges that each person has their own skills and knowledge, and they should stick to these rather than venturing into unknown territory where they might fail.\n\nIt's similar to English expressions like \"stick to what you know\" or \"play to your strengths.\""
