  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed b\u00e1 \u1ecdba p\u00e0l\u00e0 k\u00ed \u1ecdko\u0301\u0323 \u1ecdba m\u00e1 \u1e63\u00e0n-\u00e1nni l\u00e9\u0323s\u00e8\u0323\" translates to \"One does not engage in a dispute with a king without the king's staff striking them on the leg.\"\n\nThis proverb emphasizes the power and authority of a king or a person in a position of authority. It suggests that challenging or confronting someone with significant power or influence is likely to result in consequences or repercussions. The \"king's staff\" symbolizes the authority and power that the king wields, and the act of it striking someone on the leg represents the inevitable consequences of challenging such authority. The proverb serves as a cautionary reminder to be mindful of the power dynamics in any situation and to approach those in authority with respect and caution."
