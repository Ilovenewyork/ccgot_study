  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Eating until it's finished, eating without control, eating with ten fingers - these are not befitting of a human being.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis Yoruba proverb emphasizes proper conduct and self-restraint during meals. It criticizes three behaviors:\n\n1. \"\u00c0-j\u1eb9-t\u00e1n\" - Eating everything until nothing remains, showing greed\n2. \"\u00c0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-m\u1ecdra\" - Eating without self-control or restraint\n3. \"K\u00e1 fi \u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 m\u1eb9\u0301w\u1eb9\u0300\u1eb9\u0300w\u00e1 j\u1eb9un\" - Using all ten fingers to eat (instead of the culturally appropriate way)\n\nThe proverb teaches that these behaviors lack dignity and refinement (\"\u00f2 y\u1eb9 \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n\" - not befitting of a human being). In Yoruba culture, showing moderation, self-control, and proper etiquette during meals reflects good upbringing and character.\n\nThe proverb serves as a reminder that how we eat reflects our inner character and upbringing, encouraging people to practice restraint and proper manners."
