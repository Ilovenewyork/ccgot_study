  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00c0 \u0144j\u00e1 \u00ecb\u00e0\u01f9t\u1eb9\u0301 \u1eb9\u0300 l\u1eb9\u0301h\u00ecn, \u00f3 \u0144j\u00e1 tar\u00e1 iw\u00e1j\u00fa.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00ccw\u00e0 n\u00ed \u0144j\u1ecd on\u00edw\u00e0 l\u00f3j\u00fa\" translates to \"Character/behavior resembles its owner in the face\" or \"One's character reflects in one's appearance.\"\n2. This suggests that one's true nature eventually becomes visible or manifests externally.\n3. Both phrases involve the concept of connection between actions and identity.\n4. The similar phrase emphasizes how internal qualities become externally visible.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with how actions reveal true character or how past actions connect to future consequences.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"As one tears/cuts the apron strings at the back, one tears/cuts the body in front.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"J\u1eb9\u0301j\u1eb9\u0301 le\u00e9g\u00fan \u00e0gb\u00e0 \u0144j\u00f3\" translates to \"The elder masquerade dances slowly/gently.\"\n2. This phrase emphasizes how wisdom manifests in measured, deliberate actions.\n3. It suggests that experience brings caution and awareness of consequences.\n4. This connects to our proverb by highlighting the relationship between actions and their effects.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase adds the dimension of wisdom and foresight - understanding that actions have consequences, and those who are wise act with awareness of these connections.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"As one tears the apron at the back, one tears one's body in front.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that actions done to others (represented by tearing the apron behind) ultimately affect oneself (tearing one's own body in front). It's a powerful expression of the law of reciprocity or karma in Yoruba wisdom. The proverb warns that harm done to others, even secretly or \"behind their back,\" will eventually return to harm the doer. It encourages ethical behavior by highlighting the interconnectedness of all actions within the community.\n- References: The first similar phrase shows how character becomes visible, while the second emphasizes how wisdom manifests in careful, measured actions with awareness of consequences.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0 \u0144j\u00e1 \u00ecb\u00e0\u01f9t\u1eb9\u0301 \u1eb9\u0300 l\u1eb9\u0301h\u00ecn, \u00f3 \u0144j\u00e1 tar\u00e1 iw\u00e1j\u00fa\" translates to \"As one tears the apron at the back, one tears one's body in front.\" It teaches that harm done to others (even behind their back) ultimately returns to harm oneself. This reflects the Yoruba belief in cosmic justice and the interconnectedness of community. Like the similar phrases that show how character becomes visible in one's face and how wise elders move with deliberate caution, this proverb emphasizes that all actions have consequences that eventually come full circle to affect the doer."
