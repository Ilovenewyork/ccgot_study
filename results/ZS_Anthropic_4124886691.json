  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"The light drizzle of Ijesa, it touches one's body but costs nothing.\"\n\nThis proverb refers to something that seems insignificant or costs nothing but still has an effect or impact. It uses the metaphor of a light rain (from the Ijesa region) that falls on someone - though it's gentle and \"free,\" you still get wet. It could be used to describe small gestures or experiences that may seem minor but still have meaningful consequences."
