  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of \"B\u00ed ay\u00e1 b\u00e1 moj\u00fa \u1ecdk\u1ecd, al\u00e1r\u00ecnn\u00e0 a y\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300.\"\n\n## Translation\n\"When a wife knows her husband's face (understands him well), the mediator steps aside.\"\n\n## Explanation\nThis Yoruba proverb speaks to the nature of intimate relationships, particularly marriage. It means that when a wife truly understands her husband - his moods, preferences, character, and ways - there's no need for outside intervention or mediation in their affairs.\n\nThe proverb uses \"moj\u00fa\" (knows the face) metaphorically to represent deep understanding beyond just physical recognition. When spouses develop this level of understanding, third parties (\"al\u00e1r\u00ecnn\u00e0\" - the mediator or go-between) naturally become unnecessary and should withdraw (\"y\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300\" - step aside).\n\nThis wisdom highlights the importance of direct communication and understanding between couples, suggesting that intimate knowledge of one another eliminates the need for intermediaries and strengthens the marital bond."
