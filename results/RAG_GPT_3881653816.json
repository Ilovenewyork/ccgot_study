  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"E\u0323ni \u00e0 b\u00e1 t\u00e0 k\u00e1 fow\u00f3-o r\u00e8\u0323 ra \u00e0d\u00e1: \u00f3 n\u00ed \u00ecy\u00e0 \u00e0d\u00e1 \u0144j\u1eb9 \u00f2un\" translates to \"The person we sell to and use the money to buy a cutlass: he says the suffering of the cutlass is affecting him.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb is used to describe a situation where someone complains about the consequences of their own choices or actions. In this context, the person has been sold (metaphorically) and the proceeds used to buy a cutlass, which is a tool associated with hard work and labor. The person then complains about the hardship or suffering that comes with using the cutlass. It highlights the irony of someone lamenting the difficulties that arise from a situation they are directly responsible for or have contributed to. Essentially, it is a commentary on taking responsibility for one's actions and the outcomes they produce."
