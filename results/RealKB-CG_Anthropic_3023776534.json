  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"A-d\u00e1-m\u00e1-l\u00e8-\u1e63e \u00e0d\u00e0b\u00e0 t\u00ed \u0144d\u00fan b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Babaal\u00e1wo k\u00ec \u00ed b\u00e8r\u00e8 \u1eb9b\u1ecd \u00e0n\u00e1\" translates to \"A diviner does not ask about yesterday's sacrifice\" or \"A babalawo doesn't inquire about sacrifices from the past.\"\n2. This suggests something about expertise, roles, and responsibilities - a true expert knows their domain and doesn't need to ask basic questions about completed tasks.\n3. This might suggest our target proverb also deals with authenticity, competence, or the nature of expertise.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the proverb may be about recognizing true expertise or natural abilities versus imitation or pretense.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One creates/makes a dove that goes 'b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300'\" or \"We create a dove that sounds 'b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300'\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Af\u00ednj\u00fau \u00c0\u00e0r\u00e9; \u00f3 fi \u00e0k\u00eds\u00e0 d\u00ed or\u00f9b\u00e0; \u00f3 \u0144w\u00e1 \u1eb9niire-\u00e9 b\u00e1 s\u00fa epo\" translates roughly to \"The fastidious person of Aare; who wraps rags as head-tie; who seeks someone to prepare palm oil soup with.\"\n2. This phrase is about pretentiousness or false appearances - someone who tries to appear wealthy or sophisticated while lacking basic necessities.\n3. Combined with our initial proverb, this suggests the theme is about inauthenticity or imitation - attempting to create something that isn't genuine.\n\nInterim Insight: Both similar phrases point to a theme of false pretenses or imitation versus authenticity. The dove making an unnatural sound \"b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" represents something artificial trying to pass as genuine.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One creates a dove that sounds 'b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300'\" (instead of the natural cooing sound)\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb critiques artificial imitation or pretense. A dove naturally has a specific cooing sound, and one that makes an unnatural sound like \"b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" is clearly fake or manufactured. It's used to describe situations where someone is attempting to pass off something inauthentic as genuine, or someone pretending to be what they are not. Like the babalawo who should know his craft without asking basic questions, or the pretentious person wearing rags while seeking luxury, the proverb warns against artificiality and celebrates authenticity.\n- References: The first similar phrase about the babalawo highlights expertise and authenticity, while the second phrase about the pretentious person emphasizes the futility of false appearances.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"A-d\u00e1-m\u00e1-l\u00e8-\u1e63e \u00e0d\u00e0b\u00e0 t\u00ed \u0144d\u00fan b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"One creates a dove that makes the sound 'b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300'.\" In Yoruba cultural context, this proverb points to inauthenticity or poor imitation. A genuine dove makes its natural cooing sound, so one that makes the strange sound \"b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" is obviously artificial. This proverb is used to describe situations where people pretend to be what they're not or when something counterfeit is trying to pass as authentic. It teaches the value of genuineness and warns against deception through poor imitation."
