  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed fi \u00ecka ro et\u00ed, k\u00e1 fi ro im\u00fa, k\u00e1 w\u00e1 t\u00fan fi ta eh\u00edn\" translates to \"One does not scratch the ear with a finger, then use it to pick the nose, and then use it to pick the teeth.\"\n\nThis proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining proper hygiene and orderliness in one's actions. It suggests that there is a correct and appropriate way to do things, and mixing up actions or using the same tool for different purposes can lead to undesirable outcomes. In a broader sense, it can be interpreted as a caution against carelessness and the need to respect boundaries and processes in various aspects of life."
