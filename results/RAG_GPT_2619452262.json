  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0\u00ec-l\u00e1p\u00e1 l\u00e0d\u00e1 \u00f2 m\u00fa; b\u00ed a b\u00e1 l\u00e1p\u00e1, \u1ecdm\u1ecd ow\u00fa to-o g\u00e9gi\" can be translated to English as \"A cutlass does not cut without strength; if one has strength, even a cotton child can cut a tree.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb emphasizes the importance of effort and strength in achieving tasks. The cutlass, a tool for cutting, is ineffective without the application of force or effort. Similarly, even someone perceived as weak or delicate (like a \"cotton child\") can accomplish significant tasks (like cutting a tree) if they apply themselves with strength and determination. The proverb teaches that success is not just about having the right tools or opportunities but also about the effort and energy one puts into using them."
