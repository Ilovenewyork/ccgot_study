  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:** \"One builds according to one's means; a person without a horse doesn't arrive with a swagger.\"\n\n**Meaning:** This proverb teaches about living within your means and being realistic about your capabilities. It conveys that people should act according to their resources and circumstances.\n\n**Deeper explanation:**\nThe proverb uses two related images:\n1. Building (or preparing) according to what you know or have\n2. The contrast of someone without a horse trying to arrive with the grandiosity of someone who has one\n\nIn Yoruba culture, this proverb counsels humility and self-awareness. It suggests that pretending to have more status or ability than you actually possess is foolish. One should acknowledge their limitations rather than putting on airs. This doesn't mean one shouldn't aspire to improve, but rather that one should be honest about their current position.\n\nThe proverb encourages authenticity and discourages pretentiousness or living beyond one's means."
