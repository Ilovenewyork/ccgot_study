  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8ni t\u00ed a f\u00e9\u0323 y\u00e0to\u0300\u0323 s\u00ed \u1eb9ni t\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f2 s\u00ed ir\u00fa \u00f2un\" can be translated to English as \"The person we love is different from the one who claims there is no one like them.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb highlights the distinction between genuine affection and self-centeredness. It suggests that the person who is truly loved is often humble and does not boast about their uniqueness or superiority. In contrast, someone who constantly claims that there is no one like them may not be as genuinely loved or appreciated. The proverb emphasizes the value of humility and the idea that true love is not about self-promotion but about genuine connection and appreciation."
