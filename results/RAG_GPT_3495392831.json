  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"O\u00fanj\u1eb9 \u1ecdm\u1ecd k\u00e9ker\u00e9 a m\u00e1a w\u1ecd \u00e0gb\u00e0 n\u00edn\u00fa; \u00f2r\u00f9ka \u1ecdm\u1ecd k\u00e9ker\u00e9 ni k\u00ec \u00ed w\u1ecd \u00e1gb\u00e1 lo\u0301\u0323wo\u0301\u0323\" can be translated to English as: \"The food of a small child can fill an elder's stomach; but a small child's ring cannot fit an elder's finger.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\n\nThis proverb highlights the idea that certain things, regardless of their origin or initial purpose, can have a broader or more significant impact than expected. The first part of the proverb suggests that something seemingly small or insignificant (like a child's portion of food) can be sufficient or beneficial for someone much older or more experienced (an elder). It implies that wisdom, knowledge, or benefits can come from unexpected or humble sources.\n\nThe second part of the proverb contrasts this by stating that a child's ring cannot fit an elder's finger, emphasizing that not everything from a smaller or younger source can be applicable or suitable for an older or more mature context. This part of the proverb serves as a reminder that while some things can transcend their original scope, others are limited by their nature or design.\n\nOverall, the proverb teaches the importance of recognizing the potential value in small or youthful contributions while also understanding the limitations that may come with them."
