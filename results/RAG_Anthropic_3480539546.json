It suggests that elders handle situations cautiously and deliberately not out of fear or weakness, but from a desire for self-preservation and longevity.\n\nThe proverb reflects the Yoruba cultural value of respecting elders for their cautious approach to life. When an elder seems hesitant or overly careful in addressing an issue, it's not cowardice but wisdom born from experience. They understand the potential consequences of hasty actions and know that some battles are not worth fighting if they threaten one's wellbeing or life.\n\nIn Yoruba society, this proverb might be used to explain why elders often counsel patience, moderation, and careful consideration rather than impulsive action or confrontation."
