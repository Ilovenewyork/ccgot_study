This particular proverb emphasizes humility and the idea that external appearances or social status may not hold value in certain situations.\n   - It also highlights the importance of self-awareness and understanding one's true nature, especially when faced with challenges.\n\nOverall, the proverb encourages introspection and the recognition that true identity and character are revealed in times of difficulty or uncertainty."
