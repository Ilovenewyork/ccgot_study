In Yoruba culture, this teaches that inappropriate conduct, immoral behavior, or actions that violate social norms will inevitably result in public scrutiny and judgment.\n\nThe wisdom here cautions people to be mindful of their behavior, as those who act dishonorably or in undignified ways should expect to become objects of public attention and criticism."
