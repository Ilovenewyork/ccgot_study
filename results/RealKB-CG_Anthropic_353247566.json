This speaks to vulnerability and risk management - when you have limited resources, you must be cautious.\n3. The phrase emphasizes consequences of momentary actions that can lead to lasting problems.\n4. It suggests prudence and careful planning when one's resources or options are limited.\n\nInterim Insight: Both phrases seem to address the relationship between a brief action or moment and its enduring consequences.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"It takes only one day to become lame/crippled; it's every day that one suffers the consequences/pain.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eccj\u1ecd\u0301 kan l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e0j\u1eb9\u0301, \u1ecdj\u1ecd\u0301 gbogbo lara \u0144tini.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eccj\u1ecd\u0301 kan l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e0j\u1eb9\u0301, \u1ecdj\u1ecd\u0301 gbogbo lara \u0144tini\" translates to \"It takes only one day to get spoiled/ruined, but one suffers the consequences every day.\"\n2. This is almost identical in meaning to our main proverb, reinforcing its importance in Yoruba thought.\n3. The repetition of this concept across proverbs highlights the cultural emphasis on foresight and caution.\n4. Both stress that momentary mistakes or misfortunes can lead to permanent or long-lasting suffering.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase confirms the main proverb's meaning about the disproportionate relationship between a brief moment of misfortune and its enduring consequences.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It takes only one day to become disabled/injured; but one suffers the pain every day thereafter.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the disparity between the brief moment when misfortune or poor decisions occur and the enduring consequences that follow. It serves as a caution against impulsive actions or carelessness, reminding people that life-changing injuries, mistakes, or misfortunes can happen in an instant, while their effects must be endured indefinitely. The proverb teaches the values of foresight, caution, and thoughtful decision-making in Yoruba culture, where wisdom is highly prized and the interconnection between present actions and future consequences is deeply understood.\n- References: The similar phrases \"Al\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd-kan k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63er\u00e9 \u00f2j\u00f2\" (One with only one cloth doesn't play in the rain) and \"\u1eccj\u1ecd\u0301 kan l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e0j\u1eb9\u0301, \u1ecdj\u1ecd\u0301 gbogbo lara \u0144tini\" (It takes one day to get ruined, but one suffers every day) both reinforce this cultural teaching about caution and the lasting impact of momentary events.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eccj\u1ecd\u0301 kan \u1e63o\u1e63o l\u00e0 \u0144t\u1eb9\u0301; ojooj\u00fam\u1ecd\u0301 loj\u00fa \u0144tini\" translates to \"It takes only one day to become disabled/injured; but one suffers the pain every day thereafter.\" This proverb teaches that momentary actions or accidents can lead to permanent consequences that must be endured indefinitely. It serves as a warning to be cautious and thoughtful, as a single unfortunate incident can result in lasting suffering. This reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on foresight, prudent decision-making, and understanding the relationship between present actions and future outcomes."
