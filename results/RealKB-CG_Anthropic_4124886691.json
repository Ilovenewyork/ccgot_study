  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"P\u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0300p\u1eb9\u0301t\u1eb9\u0300 \u00ccj\u00e8\u1e63\u00e0, \u00f3 ta s\u1eb9\u0301ni l\u00e1ra k\u00f2 w\u1ecd\u0301n.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"A\u00e1y\u00e1n ati e\u00e8r\u00e0\u00e1 \u1e63\u00edgun, w\u1ecd\u0301n n\u00ed \u00e0w\u1ecd\u0301n \u0144l\u1ecd m\u00fa ad\u00ec\u1eb9 \u00e0l\u1ecd la r\u00ed, a \u00f2 r\u00e1b\u1ecd\u0300\" roughly translates to \"The cockroach and the ant went to war, they said they were going to capture a hen, but they never returned.\"\n2. This proverb illustrates unrealistic ambition or pretense - small creatures attempting something beyond their capacity.\n3. It suggests the theme of false bravado or mismatched confrontation that may connect to our main proverb.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that the main proverb might involve someone attempting something beyond their capability or making claims they cannot fulfill.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The petty/trivial actions of an Ijesa person, it hurts someone but isn't serious/expensive.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The second similar phrase \"\u00c0gb\u00e0\u00e0gb\u00e0 \u00ecl\u00fa \u00f2 l\u00e8 p\u00e9j\u1ecd k\u00ed w\u1ecdn \u00f3 j\u1eb9 \u00ecfun \u00f2k\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0fi iy\u00e1n \u00e0n\u00e1\" translates approximately to \"The elders of the town cannot gather to eat the intestines of a bush rat, only yesterday's pounded yam.\"\n2. This proverb speaks to appropriateness, dignity, and what is worthy of attention from important people.\n3. It suggests that some matters are too trivial or undignified for serious attention.\n\nInterim Insight: This reinforces the idea that the main proverb likely deals with triviality or insignificance - actions that might appear to have impact but are ultimately inconsequential.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The petty actions of an Ijesa person may seem to hurt but aren't significant.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to situations where someone's actions or words might seem offensive or harmful on the surface, but ultimately lack substance or significance. It characterizes these actions as \"p\u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0300p\u1eb9\u0301t\u1eb9\u0300\" (trivial or petty) and associates them with Ijesa people, suggesting a cultural stereotype about that subgroup. The proverb teaches discernment - the ability to distinguish between genuine threats or insults and those that are merely superficial. It encourages people not to overreact to minor provocations or to be overly concerned with trivial matters that may sting momentarily but cause no lasting harm.\n\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce the theme of distinguishing between appearance and reality. The first phrase shows the folly of exaggerated claims (like the main proverb's characterization of actions that seem harmful but aren't serious), while the second emphasizes the importance of not treating trivial matters with undue significance.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"P\u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0300p\u1eb9\u0301t\u1eb9\u0300 \u00ccj\u00e8\u1e63\u00e0, \u00f3 ta s\u1eb9\u0301ni l\u00e1ra k\u00f2 w\u1ecd\u0301n\" translates to \"The petty actions of an Ijesa person may seem to hurt but aren't significant.\" It teaches that some provocations or offenses may sting momentarily but lack real consequence or lasting impact. The proverb encourages wisdom in distinguishing between genuine threats and mere annoyances, suggesting that not everything that appears harmful deserves a serious response."
