  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n**Literal translation:** \"A child's food can fit into an elder's stomach; but a child's ring cannot fit onto an elder's finger.\"\n\n**Meaning:** This proverb highlights the difference between physical capacity and appropriateness of size. While an adult can easily consume a child's portion of food (as the adult's stomach is larger), a child's ring is physically too small for an adult's finger.\n\n**Deeper meaning:** The proverb teaches about knowing your limits and understanding what is appropriate for your position or status. It suggests that while some things can be shared or transferred between people of different ages or status (like food), other things simply won't fit or be appropriate (like the ring). \n\nIt's a lesson about recognizing natural limitations and not trying to force situations that are fundamentally incompatible. It could be applied to advise against adults adopting childish behaviors, or more broadly, to warn against attempting to force oneself into roles or situations that are inherently unsuitable."
