  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"A slave does not eat what is not sold in the market.\"\n\nThe proverb essentially means that people in subordinate positions (symbolized by the \"slave\") cannot expect to have access to rare or exclusive things that aren't available to the general public (represented by \"what is not sold in the market\"). It speaks to the limitations imposed by one's social position and suggests that those with less power or privilege typically have access only to common resources, not special privileges."
