  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n**Literal translation:** \"If there weren't problems for humans, who would wake up in the morning and not wash their face properly?\"\n\n**Meaning explanation:** This Yoruba proverb suggests that difficulties and challenges are what motivate people to take proper care of themselves and be vigilant. It implies that without problems or troubles to worry about, people might become careless or negligent.\n\nThe proverb uses the morning face-washing routine as a metaphor - something everyone normally does carefully. It suggests that facing challenges makes us more attentive and disciplined in life, while comfort might lead to laziness or carelessness.\n\nIn broader context, it conveys the wisdom that adversity serves a purpose in human life by keeping us alert and making us take necessary precautions. Without challenges, we might become complacent and fail to properly prepare ourselves for life's demands."
