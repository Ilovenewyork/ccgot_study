The vulture (ig\u00fan) is a powerful bird that soars high and has a certain status, while the bird that merely pretends to be like a vulture lacks the actual capabilities and ends up in a lowly position - sleeping behind the chicken coop (\u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2).\n\nThe proverb teaches that pretending to be something you're not or comparing yourself to those far above your station without having the necessary qualities or abilities will only lead to disappointment and possibly humiliation. It encourages people to be authentic and to develop themselves genuinely rather than merely imitating others or putting on airs.\n\nThis wisdom applies to situations where people try to claim status, importance, or abilities they haven't earned or don't possess."
