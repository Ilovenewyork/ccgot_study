This implies a disconnect between the perception of others and the self-awareness or concern of the individual in question.\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely highlights a situation where external concern or sympathy is not matched by the individual's own concern for themselves.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation**  \n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.  \nTranslation: \"Everyone is crying for B\u00e1nj\u1ecd; but B\u00e1nj\u1ecd does not cry for himself.\"\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection**  \nSimilar Phrase 2: M\u00e9l\u00f2\u00f3 l\u00c8j\u00ecgb\u00f2 t\u00ed o\u0300\u0323kan \u00e8\u0323 \u0144j\u00e9\u0323 Ay\u00e9-gbogbo?\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2**  \n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.  \nChain-of-Thought:  \n1.

This adds a layer of understanding that appearances can be deceiving, and not all concern is genuine or reciprocated.\nInterim Insight: The proverb may also be commenting on the superficial nature of concern or the idea that not all who express worry are genuinely affected.\n\n**Final Synthesis:**  \n- Final Translation: \"Everyone is crying for B\u00e1nj\u1ecd; but B\u00e1nj\u1ecd does not cry for himself.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: The proverb suggests a situation where others are more concerned about an individual's plight than the individual is about themselves.
