  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"K\u00ec \u00ed d\u1ecdwo\u0301\u0323-\u1ecd baba k\u00f3 l\u00f3 di \u1ecdwo\u0301\u0323 \u1ecdm\u1ecd\" translates to \"A father's hand does not become a child's hand\" in English. This proverb suggests that the responsibilities, roles, or characteristics of a father cannot simply be transferred to a child. It emphasizes the distinction between generations and the unique roles each person plays."
