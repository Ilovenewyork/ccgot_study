  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\n1) Breaking down the proverb:\n   - \"\u00d2k\u00f9nk\u00f9n \u00f2 m\u1eb9ni \u1ecd\u0300w\u1ecd\u0300\" - The first part seems to talk about darkness not recognizing or respecting someone\n   - \"\u00f3 d\u00cdf\u00e1 f\u00fan\" - This part means \"it consulted Ifa divination for\" or \"it performed Ifa for\"\n   - \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1 n\u00ecy\u1eb9n\" - This appears to be \"Is that you?\" or \"Are you the one?\"\n\n2) Analyzing the meaning:\n   The proverb appears to be using the metaphor of darkness not showing respect or recognition, and connecting it to a divination context, asking if someone is identified.\n\n3) Complete translation:\n   \"Darkness does not recognize/respect anyone; (yet) it performed divination for 'Is that you?'\"\n\nThe meaning likely conveys that in situations where there's no clear visibility (literal darkness or metaphorical obscurity), people still try to identify or recognize others, highlighting the irony of seeking identification in circumstances where recognition is impossible."
