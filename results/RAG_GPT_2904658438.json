  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Gbogbo \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n n\u00ed \u0144sunk\u00fan-un B\u00e1nj\u1ecd; \u1e63\u00f9gbo\u0301\u0323n B\u00e1nj\u1ecd \u00f2 sunk\u00fan ara \u00e8\u0323\" translates to \"Everyone is crying for B\u00e1nj\u1ecd, but B\u00e1nj\u1ecd does not cry for himself.\"\n\nThis proverb is used to describe a situation where people are more concerned about someone's problems or misfortunes than the person themselves. It highlights the irony or peculiarity of a situation where the individual at the center of concern seems indifferent or unbothered by their own circumstances, while others around them are more worried or sympathetic. It can also imply that the person might be in denial or unaware of the gravity of their situation, or it could suggest resilience or a different perspective on their part."
