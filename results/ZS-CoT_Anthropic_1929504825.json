  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down step by step:\n\n\"\u00c0fi ohun t\u00ed a k\u00ec \u00ed t\u00e0 l\u1ecd\u0301j\u00e0 l\u1eb9r\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9.\"\n\nBreaking down the components:\n- \"\u00c0fi ohun t\u00ed\" = \"Except for the thing that\"\n- \"a k\u00ec \u00ed t\u00e0\" = \"one does not sell\"\n- \"l\u1ecd\u0301j\u00e0\" = \"in the market\"\n- \"l\u1eb9r\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\" = \"a slave does not eat\"\n\nPutting it together literally: \"Except for what is not sold in the market, a slave does not eat.\"\n\nThe meaning in English would be: \"A slave does not eat what cannot be found in the market.\"\n\nThe deeper meaning of this proverb is about limitations imposed by circumstances. It suggests that people in subordinate positions (symbolized by \"slaves\") can only access or enjoy what is commonly available (represented by \"what is sold in the market\"), and have no access to rare, special, or exclusive things.\n\nIn contemporary terms, this proverb speaks to how one's social position or resources can limit one's options and experiences."
