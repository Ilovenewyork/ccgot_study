  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the proverb:\n\"K\u00ed ni w\u1ecd\u0301n ti \u0144\u1e63e \u00c0m\u1ecd\u0301d\u00f9 n\u00cdl\u1ecdrin?\" = \"What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin?\"\n\"Ew\u00far\u1eb9\u0301 \u0144j\u1eb9\u0301 b\u1eb9\u0301\u1eb9\u0300.\" = \"The goat is eating like that.\"\n\nThe proverb refers to someone named \u00c0m\u1ecd\u0301d\u00f9 in the city of Ilorin, and then makes a seemingly disconnected statement about a goat eating.\n\nThis appears to be a traditional Yoruba proverb about unconcern or indifference. The connection between the two parts creates the meaning: while something is happening to Amodu in Ilorin, the goat just continues eating, unbothered.\n\nThe English translation would be:\n\"What are they doing to Amodu in Ilorin? The goat just keeps eating.\"\n\nThe implied meaning is: \"Why should I be concerned about what's happening elsewhere (or to others) when it doesn't affect me?\" It criticizes indifference to the suffering or problems of others."
