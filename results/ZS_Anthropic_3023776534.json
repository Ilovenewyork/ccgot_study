  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"A-d\u00e1-m\u00e1-l\u00e8-\u1e63e \u00e0d\u00e0b\u00e0 t\u00ed \u0144d\u00fan b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" can be translated into English as:\n\n\"One who is created without ability is like a dove that makes the sound 'bem-be'.\"\n\nThis proverb essentially speaks to natural limitations or inherent capabilities. It suggests that everyone has their own natural talents or limitations that they are born with, similar to how a dove naturally makes its distinctive sound. It conveys the idea that we should recognize our natural abilities rather than attempting things beyond our inherent capabilities."
