  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb into English step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the proverb:\n- \"K\u00ed ni D\u00e1\u00e0r\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f3 t\u00f3 s\u1ecd\" = \"What did Daaro say before saying\"\n- \"p\u00e9 ol\u00e8-\u00e9 k\u00f3 \u00f2un\" = \"that a thief has stolen from him/her\"\n\n\"D\u00e1\u00e0r\u00f3\" appears to be a person's name in this proverb.\n\nThe complete literal translation would be: \"What did Daaro say before claiming that a thief has stolen from him?\"\n\nThis proverb is questioning what evidence or circumstances preceded Daaro's claim of theft. The implied meaning is about questioning the basis of accusations or claims before accepting them. It suggests that we should investigate what happened before someone makes an accusation, as there might be important context or preceding events that explain the situation.\n\nThe English equivalent would be: \"What did Daaro say before claiming he was robbed?\"\n\nThis proverb teaches the importance of considering the full context of a situation and not just accepting accusations at face value."
