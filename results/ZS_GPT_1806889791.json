  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed eegbo\u0301\u0323n b\u00e1 \u1e63o ay\u00ednr\u00edn n\u00edm\u00fa, ad\u00ec\u1eb9 ko\u0301\u0323 ni y\u00f3 ja\" translates to English as \"If the elder blows sand into the nose, the chicken will not peck.\" This proverb suggests that when someone in a position of authority or respect acts inappropriately, it sets a precedent that discourages others from behaving correctly."
