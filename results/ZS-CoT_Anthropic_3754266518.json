  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\n1) Breaking down the key words:\n- \"A\u00e1y\u00e1n\" = cockroach\n- \"e\u00e8r\u00e0\u00e1\" = ant\n- \"\u1e63\u00edgun\" = to set out or journey\n- \"w\u1ecd\u0301n n\u00ed\" = they said\n- \"\u00e0w\u1ecd\u0301n \u0144l\u1ecd m\u00fa\" = they are going to catch\n- \"ad\u00ec\u1eb9\" = chicken\n- \"\u00e0l\u1ecd la r\u00ed\" = we saw them going\n- \"a \u00f2 r\u00e1b\u1ecd\u0300\" = we didn't see them returning\n\n2) Constructing the literal translation:\n\"The cockroach and the ant set out on a journey, they said they were going to catch a chicken. We saw them leaving, but we didn't see them returning.\"\n\n3) The meaning of the proverb:\nThis proverb speaks about taking on tasks that are far beyond one's capabilities. A cockroach and ant are tiny insects that couldn't possibly catch a chicken, so their mission was doomed from the start. The fact that they never returned suggests they failed in their impossible mission.\n\nEnglish translation: \"The cockroach and the ant set out on a journey, claiming they were going to catch a chicken. We saw them leaving, but we never saw them return.\""
