This similar phrase contains scenarios where different entities \"t\u1eb9\u0301 l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301\" (land in the hands of) different people or things: the yam lands with the yam owner, the lizard lands on the wall, and the turtle lands in \"my\" hands.\n2. The repetition of \"t\u1eb9\u0301 l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301\" (landing in someone's hands) suggests a pattern of things naturally returning to where they belong or finding their rightful place.\n3. The phrase illustrates natural consequences and inherent relationships between entities.\n\nInterim Insight: The word \"t\u1eb9\u0301\" in this context relates to landing, settling, or ending up in someone's hands or possession. The similar phrase suggests that things ultimately find their natural or appropriate place.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Don't land in the hands of the homeowner, don't land in the hands of the visitor; one should land in one's own hands.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \"Ab\u00f9l\u00e0\u01f9g\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63as\u00e1n; b\u00edy\u00e0\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u1ecd\u0301r\u1ecd\u0300, baba a l\u00f3w\u00f3 l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase suggests that a person of mixed heritage is never without resources - if the mother doesn't have wealth/words, the father will have money in hand.\n2. It emphasizes self-reliance through family connections and acknowledges multiple sources of support.\n3. The phrase \"l\u00f3w\u00f3 l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301\" (having money in hand) relates to our proverb's focus on \"l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301\" (in the hands), reinforcing the importance of personal possession and self-sufficiency.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase emphasizes self-reliance and personal resources, suggesting that one should depend on oneself rather than on others, which aligns with our main proverb's message of self-dependence.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Don't depend on the homeowner, don't depend on the visitor; depend on yourself.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the value of self-reliance and personal responsibility in Yoruba culture. It advises against depending on others, whether they are hosts (homeowners) or guests (visitors), suggesting that true security comes from depending on oneself. The proverb reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on independence, self-sufficiency, and taking responsibility for one's own affairs. In a community-oriented culture, this proverb interestingly highlights the importance of individual agency while acknowledging the social context of homeowners and visitors.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase reinforces how things naturally belong in certain places, suggesting we too should rely on our natural resources. The second phrase supports the theme of self-reliance by showing how one should leverage their own connections and resources rather than depending on others."
