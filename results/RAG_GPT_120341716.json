  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00ccy\u00e0w\u00f3 t\u00f3 na \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u1ecdb\u00e0kan, o\u0300\u0323ro\u0300\u0323 l\u00f3 f\u00e9\u0323 gbo\u0301\u0323\" translates to \"The wife who beats the child of another wife wants to hear something\" in English.\n\nExplanation:\nIn traditional Yoruba society, polygamy is common, and it is not unusual for a man to have multiple wives, each with her own children. This proverb highlights the dynamics and potential tensions within such a household. When a wife disciplines or beats the child of another wife, it is often seen as a provocative action. The proverb suggests that the wife is not merely disciplining the child but is likely trying to provoke a reaction or start a conversation, possibly to address underlying issues or grievances. It implies that her actions are intentional and aimed at eliciting a response, either from the child\u2019s mother or from others in the household. This proverb serves as a caution against actions that may seem straightforward but have deeper, possibly disruptive, intentions."
