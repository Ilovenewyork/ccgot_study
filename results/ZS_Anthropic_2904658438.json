  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"Everyone weeps for Banjo; but Banjo does not weep for himself.\"\n\nThe proverb suggests that sometimes people might show more concern or distress about someone else's situation than the person directly affected. It can imply that outsiders may worry unnecessarily about someone who is actually handling their own circumstances well, or that we sometimes project our own feelings onto others' situations."
