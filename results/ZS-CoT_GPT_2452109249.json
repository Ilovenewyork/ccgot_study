  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"E\u0323ran k\u00ed la \u00f2 j\u1eb9 r\u00ed? \u00d2\u0323po\u0300\u0323lo\u0301\u0323 b\u00e1ni l\u00e1b\u00e0t\u00e0 \u00f3 ba b\u00far\u00fab\u00far\u00fa\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\"E\u0323ran k\u00ed la \u00f2 j\u1eb9 r\u00ed?\"** - This part of the proverb can be translated as \"What kind of meat have we not eaten before?\" It suggests familiarity or experience with various situations or challenges.\n\n2. **\"\u00d2\u0323po\u0300\u0323lo\u0301\u0323 b\u00e1ni l\u00e1b\u00e0t\u00e0\"** - \"\u00d2\u0323po\u0300\u0323lo\u0301\u0323\" means \"frog,\" and \"b\u00e1ni l\u00e1b\u00e0t\u00e0\" means \"meets one in the mud.\" So, this phrase translates to \"A frog meets one in the mud.\"\n\n3. **\"\u00f3 ba b\u00far\u00fab\u00far\u00fa.\"** - \"\u00f3 ba\" means \"it becomes\" or \"it turns into,\" and \"b\u00far\u00fab\u00far\u00fa\" means \"troublesome\" or \"problematic.\" Therefore, this part translates to \"it becomes troublesome.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as: \"What kind of meat have we not eaten before? When a frog meets one in the mud, it becomes troublesome.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that while one may have experienced many things, encountering certain situations (like meeting a frog in the mud) can still be problematic or challenging."
