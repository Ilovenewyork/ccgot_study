  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"The hawk does not catch a chicken to give insects to someone else.\"\n\nThis proverb means that people don't typically go to great lengths or make significant efforts just to benefit others. It suggests that when people take on difficult tasks, they usually do so for their own benefit rather than to help someone else. The proverb uses the imagery of a hawk (a predator) not hunting a chicken just to share the parasites/insects on the chicken with others."
