When pounding yam (a traditional food preparation method using a mortar and pestle), it's inevitable that the pestle must move up and down repeatedly.\n\nThe proverb teaches that certain processes have predictable patterns or outcomes that cannot be avoided. It's used to emphasize that actions have natural consequences that must be accepted. Just as you cannot pound yam without the up-and-down motion of the pestle, you cannot engage in certain activities without experiencing their inherent effects.\n\nIn practical application, this proverb might be used to counsel someone to accept the challenges or difficulties that naturally come with their chosen path or undertaking."
