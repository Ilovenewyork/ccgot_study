  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\nFirst, let's break down the components:\n- \"A p\u00e8 \u1ecd\u0301 l\u1ecd\u0301m\u1ecd er\u00edn-m\u00e0gb\u1ecdn\" = \"You are called a child of the elephant with thirty tusks\"\n- \"\u00f2 \u0144y\u1ecd\u0300\" = \"you don't rejoice/aren't happy\"\n- \"\u00ecw\u1ecd p\u00e0\u00e1p\u00e0\u00e1 l\u00f3 m\u00ec \u00ed?\" = \"are you the one carrying it?\" or \"are you the one bearing the weight?\"\n\nPutting it together, the proverb means:\n\n\"You are called the child of an elephant with thirty tusks, and you don't rejoice; are you the one carrying the weight?\"\n\nThe meaning behind this proverb is about perspective on honor versus burden. It suggests that when you receive an impressive title or association, you should appreciate the honor without worrying about the responsibilities that don't fall on you. Essentially, it's saying \"enjoy the prestige that comes with an association without worrying about burdens you don't actually have to bear.\""
