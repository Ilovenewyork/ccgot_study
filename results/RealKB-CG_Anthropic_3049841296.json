The similar phrase \"B\u00ed a k\u00f2 b\u00e1 t\u00f3 baba \u1ecdm\u1ecd\u1ecd\u0301 \u1e63e, a k\u00ec \u00ed pe al\u00e1k\u00e0r\u00e0\" translates to \"If you can't reach the child's father, you don't call the bean cake seller.\" This suggests proper order or protocol in Yoruba culture.\n2. This phrase emphasizes the importance of doing things in the right order or following the proper hierarchy, which may relate to our target proverb's meaning.\n3. The similar phrase warns against skipping steps or bypassing authority figures, suggesting a cultural value of respecting proper procedures.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests that the target proverb may also be about proper sequence, procedures, or focusing on the primary task before moving to secondary concerns.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"If one is pounding yam, the feet should not be sticking out.\" or \"When pounding yam, one's foot shouldn't be protruding.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed a b\u00e1 d\u00e0gb\u00e0 \u00e0 y\u00e9 ogun-\u00fan j\u00e0.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second similar phrase translates to \"When one grows old, one understands how to fight battles\" or \"With age comes wisdom about which battles to fight.\"\n2. This suggests learning from experience and gaining wisdom about proper approaches to challenges.\n3. This relates to our target proverb by reinforcing the importance of proper technique and focus - just as the elderly know which battles to choose, one should know how to properly pound yam (keeping feet tucked in for safety and proper form).\n4. In both phrases, there's a lesson about proper execution of tasks based on knowledge and attention.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb is likely advising complete concentration and proper technique when performing important tasks, similar to how experience teaches one to approach challenges correctly.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"When pounding yam, one's feet should not be sticking out.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb uses the common household activity of pounding yam (a staple food) to teach a broader lesson about focus and proper procedure. Pounding yam requires concentration and proper form - if one's feet are sticking out, it indicates improper technique and risk of injury. The proverb advises that when undertaking any important task, one should be fully committed, follow proper procedures, and avoid distractions or carelessness. It teaches the value of doing things properly and with full attention rather than haphazardly or with divided focus. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the emphasis on thoroughness and proper execution of tasks.\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce the cultural importance of proper order (Similar Phrase 1) and the wisdom of correct approaches to tasks (Similar Phrase 2).\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 \u0144g\u00fany\u00e1n, k\u00f2m\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300 \u00e1 y\u1ecd\" translates to \"When pounding yam, one's feet should not be sticking out.\" It uses the culturally significant activity of food preparation to teach about proper focus and technique. In Yoruba society, pounding yam is done in a mortar while sitting on a low stool - if one's feet are sticking out, it shows poor form and creates risk. The proverb advises complete concentration on important tasks, proper execution, and avoiding divided attention. It embodies the Yoruba cultural value of thoroughness and careful attention to process in all endeavors."
