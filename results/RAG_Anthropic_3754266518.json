  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Translation:** \"The cockroach and the ant set out on an expedition; they said they were going to catch a hen, but we only witnessed their departure, not their return.\"\n\n**Explanation:** \nThis proverb speaks about people who boast about undertaking ambitious tasks that clearly exceed their capabilities. The image of tiny insects (cockroach and ant) claiming they will capture something as large as a hen is deliberately absurd. It highlights those who make grand declarations and promises but never deliver results.\n\nThe proverb is used when someone talks big about what they intend to accomplish, but their goals are unrealistic given their resources or abilities. It serves as a caution against empty boasting and reminds us to be realistic about our capabilities.\n\nIn Yoruba culture, this saying might be used to gently mock someone who has made exaggerated claims but failed to follow through, or to warn against embarking on obviously impossible ventures."
