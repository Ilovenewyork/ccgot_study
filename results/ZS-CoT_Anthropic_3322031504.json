  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\n1) Breaking down the components:\n   - \"O\u00f2r\u00f9n\" = sun\n   - \"k\u00f3 t\u00ec\u1eb9 w\u1ecd\u0300\" = should set/go down\n   - \"k\u00e1 m\u00e1 b\u00e0\u00e1 \u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301j\u1ecd\u0301 w\u00ed\" = so that we don't have to blame/quarrel with the owner/master of the day\n\n2) Putting it together literally:\n   \"The sun should set so that we don't have to blame the owner of the day.\"\n\n3) Understanding the meaning:\n   This proverb suggests that things should follow their natural course or timing. Just as the sun naturally sets at the end of the day, we should allow events to conclude naturally rather than forcing outcomes or blaming those in authority when things don't go exactly as we want.\n\nEnglish translation: \"The sun must set so that we don't blame the owner of the day.\"\n\nThe cultural meaning implies acceptance of natural processes and timing rather than rushing or complaining about things we cannot control."
