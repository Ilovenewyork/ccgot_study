  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"B\u00ed ay\u00e1 b\u00e1 moj\u00fa \u1ecdk\u1ecd, al\u00e1r\u00ecnn\u00e0 a y\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300.\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: B\u00ed eegb\u1ecd\u0301n b\u00e1 so m\u1ecd\u0301 aj\u00e1 l\u1eb9\u0301nu, ak\u00e1t\u00e1 l\u00e0 \u0144n\u00ed k\u00f3 j\u00e1 a?\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"B\u00ed eegb\u1ecd\u0301n b\u00e1 so m\u1ecd\u0301 aj\u00e1 l\u1eb9\u0301nu, ak\u00e1t\u00e1 l\u00e0 \u0144n\u00ed k\u00f3 j\u00e1 a?\" translates to \"If a thorn gets stuck in a dog's mouth, do we ask a wildcat to remove it?\" \n2. This phrase suggests that one shouldn't involve a potentially more dangerous party to solve a delicate problem. The wildcat might harm the dog rather than help it.\n3. This suggests our target proverb likely deals with relationship dynamics and inappropriate interventions in situations.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase indicates our proverb may be about careful selection of mediators or interveners in sensitive situations, particularly when there are power dynamics or conflicts involved.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"If a wife becomes familiar with (or defiant toward) her husband, the mediator will withdraw (or step aside).\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed oj\u00fa b\u00e1 r\u00ed, \u1eb9nu a d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second phrase translates to \"When the eyes have seen, the mouth becomes silent\" - suggesting that some realities are so evident that they leave one speechless.\n2. This adds nuance to our original proverb by suggesting that when certain relationship dynamics become obvious, outsiders recognize they should not interfere.\n3. It reinforces the wisdom of non-intervention when a wife and husband have their own established dynamic, even if it appears problematic to outsiders.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase suggests our proverb concerns situations where the reality of a relationship becomes apparent, causing would-be interveners to recognize their input is unnecessary or unwelcome.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"When a wife becomes too familiar or defiant with her husband, the mediator withdraws.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the delicate nature of marital relationships and the wisdom of non-intervention. It suggests that when a wife feels comfortable enough to challenge her husband or shows disrespect, outside mediators should recognize this as a sign to step back. The proverb acknowledges that every marriage develops its own internal dynamics and communication patterns that outsiders may not fully understand. Even when these dynamics appear problematic to outside observers, intervention may be inappropriate or unwelcome. The proverb counsels wisdom in knowing when to involve oneself in others' affairs, particularly in intimate relationships where complex dynamics are at play.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase warns against bringing in potentially harmful interveners, while the second reminds us that sometimes observation alone should lead to respectful silence rather than intervention."
