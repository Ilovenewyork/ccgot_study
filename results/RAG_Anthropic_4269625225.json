  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:** \"Today, duiker soup; tomorrow, duiker soup; is duiker the only animal in the forest?\"\n\n**Meaning:** This proverb criticizes monotony, lack of variety, or repeatedly choosing the same option when alternatives are available. The \"\u1eb9t\u00fa\" (duiker/antelope) represents something that becomes tedious through constant repetition, despite many other options (other animals in the forest) being available.\n\n**Cultural context:** In traditional Yoruba cuisine, bush meat from different animals provided variety in soups and stews. The proverb uses this food context to make a broader point about the importance of variety and exploring different options in life.\n\n**Application:** This saying might be used when someone:\n- Keeps telling the same stories\n- Repeatedly uses the same approach to solve different problems\n- Fails to explore alternatives when better options might exist\n- Shows a lack of creativity or innovation when variety would be beneficial\n\nThe proverb encourages diversity of experience, thought, and action."
