The proverb is essentially asking: how can someone claim to have lost something if it's not clear they ever had it in the first place?\n\nThe proverb is used to challenge people who exaggerate their losses or complain about being deprived of things they never truly possessed. It's a way of questioning the credibility of someone's claims of victimhood or loss.\n\nThis is similar to proverb #2 in your list which expresses the same concept with slightly different wording. Both proverbs use the character \"Daaro\" as a rhetorical device to convey skepticism about unverified claims of loss.\n\nThe proverb teaches the importance of honesty and warns against false claims or exaggeration of one's possessions or losses."
