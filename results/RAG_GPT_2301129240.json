  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"E\u0323y\u1eb9 t\u00f3 fi ara w\u00e9 ig\u00fan, \u00e8\u0323h\u00ecn \u00e0d\u00ecr\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144s\u00f9n\" translates to \"The bird that compares itself to the vulture sleeps behind the kitchen.\" \n\nExplanation: In Yoruba culture, the vulture is often seen as a bird that can endure harsh conditions and survive in difficult environments. The proverb suggests that when someone tries to imitate or compare themselves to someone else without having the same capabilities or resilience, they may end up in unfavorable or uncomfortable situations. In this context, \"sleeping behind the kitchen\" implies being in a less desirable or inferior position. The proverb serves as a caution against comparing oneself to others without understanding their unique strengths or circumstances."
