  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\n1. Breaking down the components:\n   - \"Oj\u00fa \u00f2 r\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e1 r\u00ed\" - The eye has never seen honor/wealth\n   - \"\u00f3 b\u00edm\u1ecd\" - it gave birth to a child\n   - \"\u1eb9\u0300 \u00f3 s\u1ecd \u1ecd\u0301 n\u00ed \u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" - and named the child \u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu (a name that contains \"\u1ecdl\u00e1\" meaning honor/wealth)\n\n2. Understanding the meaning:\n   - This is about someone who has never experienced honor or wealth\n   - Yet this person names their child with a name suggesting honor or wealth\n   - \"\u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" appears to be a name meaning something like \"honor/wealth is sweet\" or \"honor fills the mouth\"\n\n3. The full translation:\n   \"The eye has never seen honor/wealth, yet it gives birth to a child and names it 'Honor is sweet.'\"\n\n4. The deeper meaning:\n   This proverb speaks to irony or presumption - someone who has no experience with wealth or honor yet names their child as if they do. It comments on people who claim or aspire to things they haven't actually experienced."
