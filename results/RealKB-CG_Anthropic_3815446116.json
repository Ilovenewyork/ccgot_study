  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301d\u1eb9\u0300 \u00f2 m\u1eb9\u0300y\u1eb9.\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301d\u1eb9\u0300 \u0144p\u00e0f\u1ecd\u0300, \u00f3 r\u00f2 p\u00e9 \u00f2\u00fan \u0144\u1e63oge.\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\n> Reflect on how this phrase informs the imagery or symbolism of the proverb.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301d\u1eb9\u0300 \u0144p\u00e0f\u1ecd\u0300, \u00f3 r\u00f2 p\u00e9 \u00f2\u00fan \u0144\u1e63oge\" translates to \"The pig is wallowing in mud, thinking it is beautifying itself.\"\n2. This provides important context about pigs in Yoruba culture - they're seen as animals that wallow in filth yet remain unaware of how others perceive them.\n3. The imagery suggests self-deception or lack of self-awareness - the pig thinks it's doing something admirable when others see it as dirty or inappropriate.\n4. Both phrases involve \"\u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301d\u1eb9\u0300\" (pig), suggesting our main proverb also deals with misperception or lack of awareness.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase indicates that our proverb likely refers to someone doing something inappropriate or lacking proper judgment while being unaware of their limitation.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.\n\nTranslation: \"The pig does not know birds.\" / \"The pig is not familiar with birds.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00f3 \u00e8l\u00e9 \u1e63\u1eb9\u0300\u1e63\u1ecd\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00f3 \u00e8l\u00e9 \u1e63\u1eb9\u0300\u1e63\u1ecd\u0301\" translates to \"One does not gather pigeons as decorations/ornaments.\"\n2. This proverb suggests that things should be used according to their proper nature or purpose - pigeons aren't decorative objects.\n3. There's a theme of proper categorization and understanding the natural order of things.\n4. This connects to our main proverb by reinforcing the idea of knowing one's place, limitations, or proper domain of knowledge.\n5. Both proverbs emphasize respecting natural boundaries and limitations.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase strengthens the interpretation that the original proverb is about staying within one's realm of knowledge or competence and not presuming expertise in areas where one has no experience.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The pig does not know birds.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against speaking or acting with authority on matters outside one's experience or competence. Just as a pig, a ground-dwelling animal, has no understanding of birds and their ways, people should not presume to have knowledge in areas where they lack expertise. The proverb cautions against overconfidence and encourages humility about the limits of one's knowledge. It's often used to criticize those who speak authoritatively on subjects they know nothing about.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 adds the dimension of self-deception (the pig thinks it's beautifying itself when wallowing in mud), while Similar Phrase 2 reinforces the theme of respecting natural categories and limitations.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301d\u1eb9\u0300 \u00f2 m\u1eb9\u0300y\u1eb9\" literally means \"The pig does not know birds.\" It teaches that one should not claim expertise in matters beyond their experience or understanding. Just as pigs, being land animals, have no real understanding of birds and their flight, people should recognize the limits of their knowledge and not speak authoritatively on unfamiliar subjects. This proverb promotes intellectual humility and self-awareness, cautioning against the folly of presuming knowledge where one has none."
