  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed \u00ecl\u00e0r\u00ed b\u00e1 f\u00e9\u0323 t\u00e9\u0323, a n\u00ed k\u00ed l\u1ecdba \u00f3 \u1e63e?\" translates to \"If a eunuch wants to procreate, what can the king do?\" in English.\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb is used to illustrate situations where someone desires something that is inherently impossible due to their circumstances or limitations. In this context, the eunuch, who is physically incapable of procreation, represents someone with an unattainable desire. The king, who is typically seen as powerful and capable of granting wishes, is powerless in this situation because the desire itself is beyond the realm of possibility. The proverb emphasizes the idea that some things are simply beyond anyone's control, regardless of their status or power."
