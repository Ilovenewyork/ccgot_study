  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to:\n\n\"It is due to lack of strength that the machete doesn't cut; if one has strength, a cotton fiber can cut a tree.\"\n\nThe meaning conveys that the problem isn't with the tool but with the person using it. With sufficient determination and effort, even what seems impossible (like cutting a tree with cotton) becomes possible. It emphasizes that human willpower and effort are more important than the limitations of our tools or circumstances."
