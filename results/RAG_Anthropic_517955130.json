  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n## Translation\n\"'I know my limits' is not an excuse for insults.\"\n\n## Explanation\nThis proverb addresses the concept of self-awareness and responsibility for one's actions. It suggests that claiming to know your own limitations (\"Mo m\u1ecd\u0300w\u1ecd\u0300n ara-\u00e0 mi\") should not be used as a justification or shield when you have insulted someone. \n\nThe proverb criticizes those who behave inappropriately or speak offensively to others and then try to excuse their behavior by claiming they know their own boundaries or limitations. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the importance of respectful communication and taking responsibility for one's words.\n\nThe essential wisdom here is that self-awareness should lead to better behavior, not serve as an excuse for poor behavior. True understanding of one's limits includes understanding the boundaries of acceptable social conduct."
