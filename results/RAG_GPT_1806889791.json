  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed eegbo\u0301\u0323n b\u00e1 \u1e63o ay\u00ednr\u00edn n\u00edm\u00fa, ad\u00ec\u1eb9 ko\u0301\u0323 ni y\u00f3 ja\" translates to \"If the elder sniffs the sand, the chicken will not peck it.\" \n\nExplanation: This proverb emphasizes the importance of leadership and the influence of elders or those in authority. It suggests that when a respected or wise person (the elder) takes a particular action or sets an example, others (represented by the chicken) will follow suit or refrain from certain actions. It highlights the role of elders in guiding and setting standards for the community, implying that their actions can prevent others from making mistakes or engaging in undesirable behavior."
