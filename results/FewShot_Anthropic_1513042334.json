  "gen": "Yoruba: A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00e1 \u1e63\u00ecw\u00ed; a k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00f2 s\u00f9n-\u00f9n k\u00e1 d\u00e1r\u00e0n.\nEnglish: One should not keep quiet and misspeak; one should not stare blankly and be found guilty.\n\nThis proverb essentially means that silence does not mean one agrees with wrongdoing, and mere observation doesn't make one complicit in offense. It's about the importance of speaking up against wrongdoing rather than remaining silent, which could be mistaken for consent or participation."
