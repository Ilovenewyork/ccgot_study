  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"B\u00ed in\u00e1 b\u00e1 dun \u1ecdb\u1eb9\u0300, a d\u00e1 \u1ecd\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300 s\u1ecd.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u1ecc\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300 \u00f2 d\u00f9n l\u1eb9\u0301nu \u00ecy\u00e1 ol\u00e8\" translates roughly to \"Words are not sweet in the mouth of a thief's mother\" - suggesting that someone in a difficult position cannot speak pleasantly about their situation.\n2. This relates to our proverb because both involve speech (\"\u1ecd\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300\" - words/speech) and a difficult situation - one involving a thief's mother, the other involving something burning.\n3. The similar phrase implies that circumstances affect how people communicate or what they say.\n\nInterim Insight: This suggests our proverb likely deals with how a difficult situation (something burning) prompts a particular kind of speech or communication.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"If fire burns the soup, it provokes a discussion/conversation.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed oj\u00fa b\u00e1 r\u00ed, \u1eb9nu a d\u00e1k\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"When the eye sees (something disturbing), the mouth becomes silent\" - suggesting that shocking situations can render one speechless.\n2. This contrasts with our proverb where a problematic situation (burning soup) causes speech rather than silence.\n3. Together, these proverbs show the range of responses to troubles - some situations silence us, while others demand immediate verbal response.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb indicates that some crises (like burning food) are urgent enough to demand immediate attention and discussion, breaking social protocols around speech.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"When the soup starts burning, it causes conversation.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that urgent problems demand immediate attention and discussion. In Yoruba culture, cooking is an important daily activity, and burning soup represents a domestic crisis that requires immediate intervention. The proverb is used to explain that when serious issues arise, they naturally prompt discussion and action, regardless of normal social conventions. It can be applied to situations where an emergency or crisis forces people to address issues they might otherwise avoid discussing.\n- References: The first similar phrase shows how circumstances affect speech, while the second shows the contrast between situations that silence us versus those that prompt urgent communication.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed in\u00e1 b\u00e1 dun \u1ecdb\u1eb9\u0300, a d\u00e1 \u1ecd\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300 s\u1ecd\" means \"When the soup starts burning, it causes conversation.\" It teaches that urgent problems naturally prompt immediate discussion and action. In Yoruba culture, where cooking is central to daily life, burning food represents a crisis that cannot be ignored. The proverb is often used to explain how emergencies force people to address issues directly, breaking through normal social constraints on speech and communication."
