  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0300n eku n\u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300n \u00ect\u1eb9\u0301; olongo k\u00ec \u00ed gb\u00e9 t\u00ecm\u00f9t\u00ecm\u00f9.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\n> Similar Phrase 1: Aj\u00e1 k\u00ec \u00ed gb\u00f3 n\u00edboj\u00ec \u1eb9k\u00f9n.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Aj\u00e1 k\u00ec \u00ed gb\u00f3 n\u00edboj\u00ec \u1eb9k\u00f9n\" translates to \"A dog does not bark in the den of a leopard/tiger.\"\n2. This proverb speaks to understanding one's place and limitations in a given context.\n3. It suggests that even naturally vocal creatures (dogs) know when to be quiet (in a predator's domain).\n4. This relates to our main proverb through the theme of natural limitations and appropriate behavior according to one's station.\n5. Both proverbs appear to address the concept of knowing one's boundaries and acting accordingly.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our main proverb likely deals with understanding limitations and proper conduct based on one's position or capabilities.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The size of the mouse determines the size of the trap/mat; the lizard does not take up excessive space.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\n> Similar Phrase 2: B\u00ed a b\u00e1 ti m\u1ecd l\u00e0 \u0144k\u00fa; olongo k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00fa t\u00ecy\u00e0nt\u00ecy\u00e0n.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 ti m\u1ecd l\u00e0 \u0144k\u00fa; olongo k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00fa t\u00ecy\u00e0nt\u00ecy\u00e0n\" translates to \"One dies according to one's status; a lizard does not die in an exaggerated manner.\"\n2. This proverb emphasizes that one should live and die according to their social standing or means.\n3. The reference to \"olongo\" (lizard) appears in both proverbs, suggesting it's a cultural symbol for knowing one's place.\n4. The repetition of the lizard motif confirms that the main proverb relates to modesty, propriety, and living within one's means.\n5. Both phrases emphasize the importance of not overreaching or being pretentious.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase reinforces that our main proverb addresses the virtue of modesty and accepting one's natural station in life without pretense or excess.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The size of the mouse determines the size of the trap; a lizard does not take up excessive space.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches the importance of living within one's means and accepting one's natural position in society. It uses the metaphor of a mouse trap being proportional to the mouse it's meant to catch, suggesting that provisions and accommodations should be appropriate to the need. The second part about the lizard reinforces that one should not be pretentious or take up more space (literal or figurative) than befits their station. In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to counsel against extravagance, pretentiousness, or overreaching one's social position. It emphasizes the virtues of modesty, contentment, and social appropriateness.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 (\"A dog does not bark in the den of a leopard\") and Similar Phrase 2 (\"One dies according to one's status; a lizard does not die in an exaggerated manner\") both reinforce the cultural value of knowing one's place and behaving accordingly.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0300n eku n\u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300n \u00ect\u1eb9\u0301; olongo k\u00ec \u00ed gb\u00e9 t\u00ecm\u00f9t\u00ecm\u00f9\" translates to \"The size of the mouse determines the size of the trap; a lizard does not take up excessive space.\" It teaches the importance of living within one's means and not pretending to be more than you are. This reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on appropriate behavior according to one's social position, advocating for modesty and authenticity rather than pretentiousness or excess."
