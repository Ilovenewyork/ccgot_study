  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to:\n\n\"A child's food can fit into an elder's stomach; but a child's ring cannot fit on an elder's finger.\"\n\nThe proverb conveys the idea that while adults can easily consume what would satisfy a child (showing how their needs and capacities differ in scale), physical attributes like finger size cannot be changed - highlighting natural differences and limitations between generations that cannot be overcome regardless of position or authority."
