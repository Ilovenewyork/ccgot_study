In Yoruba culture, elders are often respected for their wisdom and experience.\n\n2. **k\u00ec \u00ed**: This phrase means \"does not\" or \"never.\" It is used to indicate something that is not done or does not happen.\n\n3. **w\u1eb9wo\u0301\u0323 t\u00e1n**: The word \"w\u1eb9wo\u0301\u0323\" means \"to examine\" or \"to inspect,\" and \"t\u00e1n\" means \"finished\" or \"completed.\" Together, \"w\u1eb9wo\u0301\u0323 t\u00e1n\" means \"finished examining\" or \"completed inspection.\"\n\n4. **k\u00f3 n\u00ed**: This phrase means \"and then says\" or \"and does not say.\"\n\n5. **\u00f2un \u00f3 j\u1eb9 si**: \"\u00f2un\" means \"he/she/it,\" \"\u00f3\" is a marker for future tense, and \"j\u1eb9 si\" means \"to eat more\" or \"to continue eating.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as:\n\"An elder does not finish examining and then say he will eat more.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that a wise or experienced person does not make decisions or take actions without careful consideration or after having thoroughly examined a situation. It emphasizes the importance of thoughtful deliberation before proceeding with further actions."
