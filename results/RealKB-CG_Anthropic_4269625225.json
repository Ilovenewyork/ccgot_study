  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00d2n\u00ed, \u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn, \u1ecd\u0300la, \u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn; \u1eb9tu n\u00eckan l\u1eb9ran t\u00f3 w\u00e0 n\u00edgb\u00f3?\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u00c0n\u00e1n-m\u00e1n\u00e0\u00e1n \u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn; on\u00ed-m\u00f3n\u00ec\u00ed \u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn; \u1eb9ran m\u00ec\u00edr\u00e0n \u00f2 s\u00ed n\u00edgb\u00f3 l\u1eb9\u0301h\u00ecn \u1eb9tu?\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. Both phrases share the repetitive \"\u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn\" structure, suggesting monotony or repetition of the same thing.\n2. Both mention \"\u1eb9tu\" (antelope/duiker) and \"\u00edgb\u00f3\" (forest), indicating a forest hunting context.\n3. Both end with rhetorical questions asking if antelope is the only animal in the forest.\n4. \"\u00c0n\u00e1n-m\u00e1n\u00e0\u00e1n\" and \"on\u00ed-m\u00f3n\u00ec\u00ed\" in the similar phrase represent \"yesterday\" and \"today,\" similar to \"\u00f2n\u00ed\" (today) and \"\u1ecd\u0300la\" (tomorrow) in the original proverb.\n\nInterim Insight: This proverb appears to criticize fixation on a single option when many alternatives exist. The hunter who keeps bringing home only antelope is being questioned about their limited vision or effort.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Today, antelope meat again, tomorrow, antelope meat again; is antelope the only animal in the forest?\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: L\u00e1gb\u00e1j\u00e1 \u00ecb\u00e1 w\u00e0 a di \u00ecj\u00edm\u00e8r\u00e8; \u1eb9ni t\u00f3 b\u00e1 n\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa di oloyo?\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase uses \"L\u00e1gb\u00e1j\u00e1\" (a placeholder name like \"So-and-so\") to talk about someone becoming \"\u00ecj\u00edm\u00e8r\u00e8\" (a baboon/monkey).\n2. The second part mentions \"\u1eb9ni t\u00f3 b\u00e1 n\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa di oloyo\" suggesting that whoever is in front becomes fortunate or blessed.\n3. This appears to be about opportunity, transformation, and the contrast between those who succeed and those who don't.\n4. When connected to our proverb, it reinforces the idea of alternatives and choices \u2013 not being limited to one path or option.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase adds the dimension of transformation and opportunity. In Yoruba worldview, one should not limit oneself to a single path when multiple opportunities exist.\n\n## Final Synthesis\n- Final Translation: \"Today, antelope meat again, tomorrow, antelope meat again; is antelope the only animal in the forest?\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes lack of variety, initiative, or imagination. It questions why someone would repeatedly do the same thing or choose the same option when alternatives exist. In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to encourage innovation, exploration of new opportunities, or to criticize someone who is stuck in a rut. It reflects the Yoruba value of resourcefulness and adaptability. The forest (igb\u00f3) in Yoruba cosmology represents abundance and diversity \u2013 a place with many possibilities that should not be limited to just one choice.\n\n- References: The repetitive structure in Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the monotony being criticized, while Similar Phrase 2 adds the cultural dimension of transformation and opportunity that comes with exploring alternatives.\n\nFinal Answer: This Yoruba proverb criticizes repetition and lack of variety when alternatives are available. Literally translated as \"Today, antelope meat again, tomorrow, antelope meat again; is antelope the only animal in the forest?\", it questions why someone would continuously pursue the same thing when other options exist. It's used to encourage exploration, innovation, and taking advantage of diverse opportunities in life, reflecting the Yoruba cultural value of resourcefulness."
