The similar phrase \"\u1eccl\u1ecdgb\u1ecd\u0301n \u00f2 t\u1eb9 ara \u1eb9\u0300 n\u00cdf\u00e1; \u1ecd\u0300m\u1ecd\u0300r\u00e0n \u00f2 fi ara \u1eb9\u0300 joy\u00e8; ab\u1eb9 t\u00f3 m\u00fa \u00f2 l\u00e8 gb\u1eb9\u0301 \u00e8k\u00f9 ara \u1eb9\u0300\" translates roughly to \"A wise person doesn't make himself a diviner; a knowledgeable person doesn't make himself a chief; a sharp knife cannot shave its own handle.\"\n2. This speaks to the limitations of self-service and the importance of recognizing one's position and limitations, even when skilled or powerful.\n3. It suggests that everyone has roles they cannot fulfill for themselves, indicating a social order where interdependence is necessary.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase emphasizes the importance of recognizing one's limitations and proper place in the social order, which appears to relate to the theme of self-awareness in our target proverb.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Let the slave know himself as a slave; let the pawn know himself as a pawn; let the person of good character know himself as a servant of God the king.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The phrase \"\u1eccj\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00ed mo ti \u1e3fb\u1ecd\u0300 ng \u00f2 r\u00edr\u00fa \u1eb9\u0300 r\u00ed\": ol\u00fawa \u1eb9\u0300-\u1eb9\u0301 m\u1ecd \u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300n ara \u1eb9\u0300 ni\" roughly translates to \"Since I've been worshipping, I've never seen its like\": the master/owner knows his own worth/limits.\"\n2. This phrase suggests that recognizing one's limitations and worth is a sign of wisdom and proper self-understanding.\n3. It reinforces the idea that even those in positions of authority (masters/owners) must understand their own boundaries and limitations.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase adds the dimension that self-awareness applies to everyone regardless of social status, and that understanding one's position is a form of wisdom, not just submission.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"Let the slave recognize their position as a slave; let the indentured servant recognize their position as such; let the person of good character recognize themselves as a servant of God the king.\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb speaks to the importance of self-awareness and acceptance of one's position in the social and cosmic order. In traditional Yoruba society, understanding one's place was crucial for social harmony. However, the proverb moves beyond mere social hierarchy to make a profound spiritual point: regardless of social status, everyone (even those of high moral standing - \u1ecdm\u1ecdl\u00faw\u00e0b\u00ed) ultimately serves God. This creates a universal humility that transcends earthly status. The proverb doesn't necessarily endorse slavery or servitude as institutions, but uses these social categories to illustrate that self-knowledge and understanding one's relationship to divine authority brings wisdom and proper conduct. For the Yoruba, recognizing one's position in relation to others and to God represents spiritual maturity and social responsibility.\n\n- **References:** Both similar phrases reinforce the core message that self-awareness of one's limitations and proper place is essential for all individuals regardless of status, and that even those with power or virtue must recognize a higher authority."
