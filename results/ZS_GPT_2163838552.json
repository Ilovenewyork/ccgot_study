  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed \u00ecl\u00e0r\u00ed b\u00e1 f\u00e9\u0323 t\u00e9\u0323, a n\u00ed k\u00ed l\u1ecdba \u00f3 \u1e63e?\" translates to English as \"If the royal messenger wants to fail, what can the king do?\" This proverb suggests that when someone in a position of responsibility or trust decides to fail or not fulfill their duties, there is little that those in higher authority can do to prevent it. It highlights the importance of personal responsibility and integrity."
