This similar phrase suggests that someone with limited resources (only one cloth) cannot afford to take risks (playing in the rain) that could damage their only possession.\n3. The concept emphasizes prudence when one has limited resources - the person must be careful with their sole possession.\n4. This helps understand the original proverb's likely focus on resource management and caution.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase indicates that the original proverb likely addresses prudent behavior when one has limited resources, specifically related to clothing or material possessions.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.\n\nTranslation: \"A person with only one cloth does not spread it to dry for others.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A k\u00ec \u00ed pe \u00ecy\u00e0w\u00f3 k\u00f3 kan al\u00e1r\u1eb9n\u00e0.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A k\u00ec \u00ed pe \u00ecy\u00e0w\u00f3 k\u00f3 kan al\u00e1r\u1eb9n\u00e0\" translates roughly to \"One doesn't call a bride to affect the go-between/intermediary.\"\n2. This proverb suggests that people should respect established protocols and hierarchies - the bride shouldn't bypass or interfere with the intermediary's role.\n3. It speaks to the importance of respecting boundaries and roles within Yoruba cultural contexts.\n4. This adds a dimension of social boundaries and proper conduct to the interpretation of our original proverb.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase suggests that the original proverb may also relate to proper social conduct, responsibilities, and knowing one's limitations within community structures.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"A person with only one cloth doesn't lend it out to others to dry.\"\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb teaches prudence and self-preservation when one has limited resources. Just as a person with only one garment cannot afford to lend it to others (as they would have nothing to wear), people should be careful about depleting their limited resources by trying to help others. It emphasizes the importance of securing one's own stability before extending help to others. In Yoruba culture, where community support is valued but personal responsibility is essential, this proverb reminds individuals to balance generosity with self-preservation. It acknowledges that one must first take care of their own basic needs before being in a position to assist others.\n- **References:** Similar Phrase 1 (\"A person with only one cloth doesn't play in the rain\") reinforces the message of protecting limited resources, while Similar Phrase 2 relates to understanding proper social boundaries and responsibilities.\n\nFinal Answer:\nThe Yoruba proverb \"Al\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd-kan k\u00ec \u00ed n\u00e1 \u00e0n\u00e1r\u1eb9\" translates to \"A person with only one cloth doesn't lend it out to others to dry.\" It teaches that those with limited resources must be prudent about how they use or share them. In Yoruba wisdom, while generosity is valued, one must first ensure their own basic needs are met before extending help to others. The proverb serves as practical advice about self-preservation and responsible resource management within community contexts."
