  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb \"K\u00ec \u00ed d\u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301-\u1ecd baba k\u00f3 l\u00f3 di \u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 \u1ecdm\u1ecd\" translates to English as:\n\n\"What is in the father's hand does not easily transfer to the child's hand.\"\n\nThe proverb speaks to the idea that a father's possessions, wealth, status, or achievements don't automatically pass to his children. It emphasizes that inheritance isn't guaranteed, and children may need to work to earn or maintain what their parents have built."
