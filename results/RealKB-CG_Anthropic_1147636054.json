The similar phrase \"\u1ecc\u0300\u1e63\u00ecn \u00f2 l\u00e8 m\u00fa \u00e0w\u00f2d\u00ec \u00f2k\u00e8; B\u00e1mid\u00e9l\u00e9 l\u1ecd\u0300\u1e63\u00edn l\u00e8 m\u00fa\" translates to \"A sleep-walker cannot catch the eagle of the hill; only Bamidele (a name meaning 'follow me home') can catch it.\"\n2. This suggests limitations of capability - someone in a diminished state (sleep-walker) cannot accomplish a difficult task (catching an eagle).\n3. The mention of \"\u1eb9l\u1eb9\u0301\u1e63in\" (horseman/horse owner) in our target proverb likely connects to themes of capability, status, and expectations.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb may deal with matching appropriate actions to capabilities, particularly regarding someone of status (horseman).\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Pull it inside\" is what befits the horseman/horse owner.\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1 \u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 l\u00e9 ohun t\u00ed a \u00f2 l\u00e8 gb\u00e9.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The phrase \"A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1 \u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 l\u00e9 ohun t\u00ed a \u00f2 l\u00e8 gb\u00e9\" translates to \"One doesn't place hands on what one cannot lift.\"\n2. This conveys wisdom about not attempting tasks beyond one's capability or overreaching.\n3. Connected to our proverb, it suggests the horseman is being advised to take appropriate action within his means - pulling the horse inside rather than attempting something more difficult or unsuitable.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces that our proverb likely advises taking appropriate action according to one's position and capabilities, rather than attempting unsuitable actions.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Pull it inside\" is what befits the horseman.\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb advises that a horseman should focus on actions appropriate to his status and capabilities - specifically bringing the horse inside rather than leaving it outside or attempting something beyond what's expected. It speaks to the importance of fulfilling one's responsibilities according to one's station in life. The proverb teaches that wisdom lies in knowing what actions are appropriate to one's role and executing them properly, rather than neglecting basic duties or overreaching. In Yoruba culture, where social roles and responsibilities are clearly defined, this proverb reminds people to fulfill the expectations of their position.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase about the sleep-walker unable to catch the eagle illustrates limitations of capability, while the second phrase about not placing hands on what one cannot lift reinforces the wisdom of acting within one's means and appropriate role."
