Moths often fly toward flames or bright lights and can get burned or killed as a result. \n\nThe proverb warns against overestimating one's abilities or challenging forces far greater than oneself. It suggests that when someone threatens to destroy or overcome something that is inherently more powerful than they are, they will likely end up harming themselves instead.\n\nIn broader cultural context, this proverb teaches humility and caution, warning against hubris or taking on challenges beyond one's capacity. It's a reminder that sometimes our own aggression or overconfidence can lead to our downfall, especially when we fail to recognize the true power of what we're confronting."
