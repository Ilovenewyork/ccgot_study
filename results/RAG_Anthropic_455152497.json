  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal Translation:**\n\"It is refusing-to-leave that kills the housefly; it is refusing-to-leave that kills the moth; it is refusing-to-leave that kills the insect.\"\n\n**Meaning:**\nThis proverb speaks to the danger of overstaying one's welcome or failing to recognize when it's time to depart a situation. It warns that persistence in the wrong context leads to destruction.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe proverb uses three examples of insects (housefly, moth, and small insect) that often meet their demise because they linger too long in dangerous places. For example:\n- The housefly that refuses to leave food will eventually be swatted\n- The moth that stays around a flame will get burned\n- The small insect that doesn't flee from danger will be crushed\n\nThis wisdom applies to human situations where knowing when to withdraw is essential for survival. It teaches that recognizing the right moment to exit a harmful situation, relationship, or endeavor is critical to avoiding disaster.\n\nThe proverb essentially counsels discernment and cautions against stubborn persistence when circumstances clearly indicate it's time to move on."
