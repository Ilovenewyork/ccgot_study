The similar phrase \"\u00c0j\u00e0p\u00e1 \u0144l\u1ecd s\u00e1j\u00f2, w\u1ecd\u0301n n\u00ed \u00ecgb\u00e0 wo ni y\u00f3 d\u00e8\u00e9, \u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f3 d\u00ecgb\u00e0t\u00ed \u00f2\u00fan b\u00e1 t\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"The tortoise is going to a party, they asked when he would arrive, he said when he's ready/when he gets there.\"\n2. This phrase highlights the tortoise's notorious unhurried pace and indeterminate timing in Yoruba folklore.\n3. Both proverbs seem to involve journeys with uncertain outcomes or returns.\n4. The tortoise saying he'll arrive \"when he gets there\" suggests noncommittal responses that avoid making concrete promises.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the proverb may be about undertaking journeys with uncertain returns or making promises without fulfillment.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Cockroach and ant set out on a journey, they said they were going to catch a flying chicken, we saw them depart but never saw them return.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00c0gb\u00e0\u00e0gb\u00e0 \u00ecl\u00fa \u00f2 l\u00e8 p\u00e9j\u1ecd k\u00ed w\u1ecdn \u00f3 j\u1eb9 \u00ecfun \u00f2k\u00e9t\u00e9, \u00e0fi iy\u00e1n \u00e0n\u00e1\" translates to \"The elders of the town cannot gather together to eat the intestines of a bush rat, only yesterday's pounded yam.\"\n2. This phrase speaks to impossibility - the intestines of a bush rat are too small for multiple elders to share meaningfully.\n3. Both proverbs deal with impractical endeavors or unrealistic expectations.\n4. The notion of collective action toward an impossible goal connects with the original proverb about insects trying to catch a flying chicken.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces the theme of attempting something fundamentally impossible or beyond one's capabilities, which helps explain why the insects in our proverb never returned.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Cockroach and ant set out on a journey, claiming they were going to catch a flying chicken; we saw them depart but never saw them return.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the folly of undertaking impossible tasks or making grandiose claims beyond one's capabilities. The cockroach and ant represent individuals making unrealistic boasts (catching a flying chicken would be impossible for such small insects). The proverb warns against embarking on journeys or projects with unrealistic goals, as failure is inevitable. It teaches the importance of knowing one's limitations and being practical in one's ambitions. The proverb can be used to caution against empty boasting or undertaking ventures doomed to fail due to their inherent impossibility.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase about the tortoise going to a party highlights the theme of uncertain journeys, while the second phrase about elders eating bush rat intestines reinforces the concept of attempting something fundamentally impossible."
