  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"Oj\u00fa \u00f2 ro\u0301\u0323l\u00e1 r\u00ed; \u00f3 b\u00edm\u1ecd \u00e8\u0323 \u00f3 s\u1ecd o\u0301\u0323 n\u00ed \u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Oj\u00fa** - This means \"eye\" or \"face\" in Yoruba.\n2. **\u00f2 ro\u0301\u0323l\u00e1 r\u00ed** - \"\u00f2\" is a negation, \"ro\u0301\u0323l\u00e1\" means \"wealth\" or \"prosperity,\" and \"r\u00ed\" means \"see.\" So, \"\u00f2 ro\u0301\u0323l\u00e1 r\u00ed\" translates to \"has not seen wealth\" or \"has not experienced prosperity.\"\n3. **\u00f3 b\u00edm\u1ecd \u00e8\u0323** - \"\u00f3\" means \"it\" or \"he/she,\" \"b\u00edm\u1ecd\" means \"gave birth to a child,\" and \"\u00e8\u0323\" is a possessive pronoun meaning \"its\" or \"his/her.\" So, \"\u00f3 b\u00edm\u1ecd \u00e8\u0323\" translates to \"it gave birth to its child\" or \"he/she gave birth to his/her child.\"\n4. **\u00f3 s\u1ecd o\u0301\u0323 n\u00ed \u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu** - \"\u00f3\" means \"it\" or \"he/she,\" \"s\u1ecd\" means \"named\" or \"called,\" \"o\u0301\u0323\" is a pronoun meaning \"it\" or \"him/her,\" \"n\u00ed\" means \"as\" or \"to,\" and \"\u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" is a name that can be broken down into \"\u1eccl\u00e1\" (wealth) and \"\u00ecy\u1ecdnu\" (trouble or worry). So, \"\u00f3 s\u1ecd o\u0301\u0323 n\u00ed \u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" translates to \"named it \u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" or \"called him/her \u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as:\n\"The eye has not seen wealth; it gave birth to its child and named it 'Wealth is a burden.'\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that those who have not experienced wealth may not understand the challenges or responsibilities that come with it."
