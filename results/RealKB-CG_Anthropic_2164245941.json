  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00c0w\u00far\u00e8be\u00e9 n\u00ed \u00f2\u00fan l\u00e8 y\u1eb9\u0300n\u00e0; ta n\u00ed j\u1eb9\u0301 t\u1ecd \u1ecd\u0300n\u00e0 \u00e0w\u00far\u00e8be?\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u00c0gb\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0w\u00f2d\u00ec n\u00ed \u0144n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 j\u1eb9 \u00ecgb\u00edn.\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0gb\u00e9r\u00e9 \u00e0w\u00f2d\u00ec n\u00ed \u0144n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 j\u1eb9 \u00ecgb\u00edn\" translates roughly to \"The promiscuous hawk claims it will eat the snail.\" This is a proverb about making empty boasts or impossible claims.\n2. A hawk cannot easily eat a snail because of the snail's protective shell, so this represents an idle or meaningless boast.\n3. This suggests our target proverb may also deal with unrealistic claims or someone overestimating their abilities.\n4. Both proverbs appear to use animal or natural imagery to convey lessons about human behavior and limitations.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely addresses someone making unrealistic claims or promises they cannot fulfill, possibly using metaphorical language about animals or natural elements.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The grasshopper claims it can clear the path; who will follow the path of a grasshopper?\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eb8n\u00eckan k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\u0301 \"\u00c0w\u00e1 d\u00e9.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eb8n\u00eckan k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\u0301 '\u00c0w\u00e1 d\u00e9'\" translates to \"One person cannot be 'We have arrived'\" or \"A single person cannot claim to be a group.\"\n2. This proverb emphasizes that one person cannot represent or speak for many, highlighting limitations of individual claims or representation.\n3. This adds context to our main proverb by suggesting it's not just about boastfulness but about the limits of individual capability versus collective action.\n4. The grasshopper proverb and this phrase both question inappropriate claims of capability or representation.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase confirms our proverb addresses the mismatch between claimed abilities and actual capabilities, specifically questioning individual claims to accomplish tasks that might require collective effort.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The grasshopper claims it can clear the path; who would follow the path cleared by a grasshopper?\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes those who make grand claims beyond their actual capabilities. A grasshopper is too small to effectively clear a path that would be useful to others, just as some people boast about abilities they don't possess. The proverb questions not just the boast itself but also suggests that even if such claims were true, they would be of little value to others. It teaches humility and warns against following those who make unrealistic promises. In Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to caution against following unreliable leaders or believing in empty promises.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase about the hawk and snail reinforces the theme of impossible boasts, while the second phrase about one person not being \"we\" emphasizes the limitations of individual claims versus collective responsibility.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0w\u00far\u00e8be\u00e9 n\u00ed \u00f2\u00fan l\u00e8 y\u1eb9\u0300n\u00e0; ta n\u00ed j\u1eb9\u0301 t\u1ecd \u1ecd\u0300n\u00e0 \u00e0w\u00far\u00e8be?\" translates to \"The grasshopper claims it can clear the path; who would follow the path cleared by a grasshopper?\" It warns against both making claims beyond one's capabilities and trusting those who make such unrealistic boasts. In Yoruba wisdom, this teaches discernment in choosing who to follow and cautions against self-aggrandizement."
