This phrase speaks to the importance of knowing background information before making judgments or claims about a situation.\n3. It suggests that complaints about outcomes should be contextualized by understanding previous actions or circumstances.\n4. There's an emphasis on history and prior context being necessary for proper assessment.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with the importance of understanding history or background before accepting an inheritance or making claims about what one deserves.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Where we hear the history before inheriting, we should know that the inheritance there doesn't affect us.\" OR \"The place where we must listen to stories before inheriting, know that such inheritance doesn't concern us.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 ti m\u1ecd l\u00e0 \u0144k\u00fa; olongo k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00fa t\u00ecy\u00e0nt\u00ecy\u00e0n\" translates to \"One dies as one is known; the lizard doesn't die in an undignified manner.\"\n2.

In Yoruba culture, legitimate inheritances or benefits should come naturally to those entitled to them. If you find yourself in a situation where you must be convinced or persuaded with stories before receiving something, it suggests that it may not rightfully belong to you or might come with hidden problems. It teaches discernment and warns against being lured by enticing opportunities that require excessive justification, as they may not align with your true path or best interests.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase reinforces the importance of knowing background information before making judgments, while the second phrase emphasizes staying true to one's natural position and dignity rather than forcing oneself into unsuitable situations.\n\nFinal Answer: This Yoruba proverb warns that when you must listen to elaborate stories or explanations before receiving an inheritance or benefit, it's a sign that such benefit isn't truly meant for you. It teaches discernment about opportunities that require excessive justification, suggesting that what legitimately belongs to you shouldn't need elaborate convincing. In Yoruba wisdom, this reflects the cultural value of natural alignment - what is truly yours will come without complicated prerequisites or conditions."
