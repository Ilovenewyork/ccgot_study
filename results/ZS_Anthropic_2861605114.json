  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"I was born to the leopard clan, raised by a tiger, and adopted by a cat; if there is no meat in the stew, I will not eat.\"\n\nThis proverb speaks to someone's proud lineage and high standards. It suggests that a person comes from noble origins and has been brought up with certain expectations, so they refuse to settle for less than what they deserve or what is appropriate to their status."
