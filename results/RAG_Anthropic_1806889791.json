  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:**\n\"If an elder puts mucus in his nose, it is not the chicken that will peck it off.\"\n\n**Meaning:**\nThis proverb speaks to the importance of respecting social hierarchy and appropriate roles. It suggests that when an elder or authority figure has a problem (symbolized by mucus in the nose), it's not the place of someone of lower status (represented by the chicken) to solve it or point it out.\n\nThe proverb teaches about proper social boundaries and respect. Just as a chicken shouldn't approach an elder's face to peck at mucus, junior members of society shouldn't overstep their boundaries when dealing with elders or authority figures, even when they notice something wrong.\n\nThe underlying wisdom is about knowing one's place in social interactions and understanding that certain issues should be addressed by peers or those of equal status, not by subordinates."
