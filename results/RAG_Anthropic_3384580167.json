It conveys that in any category or class, there are always different levels of strength, authority, or capability.\n\nThe proverb uses three parallel examples:\n1. Among masquerades (e\u00e9g\u00fan), some are more powerful than others\n2. Among deities (\u00f2r\u00ec\u1e63\u00e1), some rank higher than others\n3. Even a Sango worshipper (on\u00ed\u1e63\u00e0ng\u00f3), who serves the powerful deity of thunder, will flee into the bush when confronted by a leopard (p\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1)\n\nThe deeper meaning teaches humility and warns against overconfidence. No matter how powerful or important one might be in their sphere, there is always someone or something more powerful. Even those who draw their identity from powerful associations (like the Sango worshipper) will find themselves humbled when confronted with a superior force (the leopard).\n\nThis proverb is often used to counsel people against excessive pride or to remind someone that power is always relative, not absolute."
