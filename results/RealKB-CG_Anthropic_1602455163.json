This relates to the main proverb through the concept of \"\u1eb9gb\u1eb9\u0301\" (peers/group/equals) appearing in both, suggesting natural affinity and association between similar entities\n3. The similar phrase implies that context can affect recognition of peers, while our main proverb seems to focus on deliberate association\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase helps establish that the main proverb likely deals with social associations and how people naturally seek out those of similar standing.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The wealthy person walks with the prosperous; peers play with peers.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Aaka \u00f2 gb\u00e9 \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n; igb\u00f3 n\u00ed \u0144gb\u00e9\" translates to \"The viper doesn't live in the savanna; it lives in the forest\" - indicating natural habitats and appropriate environments\n2. This phrase reinforces the idea that things/beings have their natural places and associations\n3. It adds the dimension that there's a natural order to relationships and associations - just as certain animals belong in certain habitats, certain people naturally associate with others like themselves\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase strengthens the interpretation that the main proverb speaks to natural social ordering and appropriate associations based on similarity or status.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The wealthy person walks with the prosperous; peers play with peers.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes that people naturally associate with those of similar status, wealth, or circumstances. It reflects the Yoruba cultural understanding of social stratification and natural affinities. The proverb serves both as an observation of social dynamics and a cautionary wisdom about knowing one's place in society. Just as creatures have their natural habitats and companions, humans tend to form relationships with those who share similar life experiences, resources, and status. This isn't necessarily presented as negative, but rather as a natural social principle to be acknowledged.\n- References: The lizard not recognizing its peers in water speaks to natural grouping, while the viper living in the forest not the savanna reinforces that entities have their natural associations and environments.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"Ol\u00f3w\u00f3 n\u00ed \u1e3fb\u00e1 \u1ecdl\u1ecd\u0301r\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd\u0301 r\u00ecn; \u1eb9gb\u1eb9\u0301 n\u00ed \u1e3fb\u00e1 \u1eb9gb\u1eb9\u0301 \u1e63er\u00e9\" translates to \"The wealthy person walks with the prosperous; peers play with peers.\" In Yoruba culture, this expresses the natural tendency for people to associate with others of similar social standing, wealth, or circumstances. Like the viper that belongs in the forest, not the savanna, people gravitate toward environments and relationships that match their status and identity. The proverb acknowledges social stratification as a natural phenomenon while suggesting we should understand where we belong in the social fabric."
