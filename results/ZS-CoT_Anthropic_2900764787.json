  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down into components and analyze it step by step.\n\n\"N\u00edgb\u00e0t\u00ed\" means \"when\" or \"while\"\n\"\u00e0 \u0144to\" means \"we are arranging\" or \"we are setting up\"\n\"\u1ecdk\u00e0\" refers to \"corn\" or \"maize\"\n\"a \u00f2 to\" means \"we do not arrange\" or \"we do not set up\"\n\"ti \u1eb9m\u1ecd\u0301 si\" means \"that of palm wine\" (\u1eb9m\u1ecd\u0301 refers to palm wine)\n\nPutting it all together, the literal translation is:\n\"When we are arranging corn, we do not arrange palm wine.\"\n\nThe English equivalent or meaning would be:\n\"When we are dealing with one matter, we don't address a completely different matter at the same time.\"\n\nThis proverb teaches about focus, prioritization, and handling one task at a time. It advises against trying to handle multiple unrelated matters simultaneously, suggesting that proper attention should be given to each distinct task in its own time."
