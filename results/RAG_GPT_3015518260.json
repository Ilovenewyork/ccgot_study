  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Al\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd-kan k\u00ec \u00ed n\u00e1 \u00e0n\u00e1r\u1eb9\" translates to \"A person with only one cloth does not dance near the fire.\" \n\nThis proverb conveys the idea of being cautious and avoiding unnecessary risks, especially when one has limited resources or options. If someone has only one piece of clothing, they must be careful not to damage it, as they have no replacement. Similarly, in life, when resources or opportunities are scarce, it is wise to be prudent and avoid actions that could lead to loss or harm."
