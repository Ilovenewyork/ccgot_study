  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u1e62\u00e0k\u00ec \u0144\u1e63e b\u00ed o\u0300\u0323r\u00e1, egungun \u0144\u1e63e b\u00ed \u1eb9ran\" can be translated to English as \"The sack behaves like a bag, the skeleton behaves like meat.\"\n\nThis proverb uses metaphorical language to convey a message about appearances and reality. A \"\u1e63\u00e0k\u00ec\" (sack) and \"o\u0300\u0323r\u00e1\" (bag) may seem similar in function, but they are different in quality and purpose. Similarly, \"egungun\" (skeleton) and \"\u1eb9ran\" (meat) may appear similar in form, but they are fundamentally different in substance.\n\nThe proverb suggests that things or people may appear similar on the surface, but they can be quite different in essence or value. It serves as a reminder not to judge based solely on appearances, as the true nature or quality of something may be hidden beneath the surface."
