  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:** \"Darkness doesn't recognize a person of honor; it casts Ifa divination for 'Who are you?'\"\n\n**Meaning:** This proverb conveys that darkness (night time) does not distinguish between people based on their social status or importance. In the dark, everyone is treated the same way, with the question \"Who are you?\" being asked of everyone regardless of their standing.\n\n**Cultural context:** The proverb uses imagery from Ifa divination (a traditional Yoruba spiritual practice) to illustrate how darkness levels all social distinctions. The mention of \"\u00ccw\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1 n\u00ecy\u1eb9n\" (Who are you?) indicates that in darkness, even important people must identify themselves since they cannot be recognized by sight.\n\n**Application:** This proverb is used to emphasize that certain circumstances (like darkness) are great equalizers that don't respect rank, wealth, or status. It can be used to remind people that in some situations, everyone faces the same challenges regardless of their position in society.\n\nThe other proverbs you provided express similar sentiments about equality in certain circumstances or questioning assumptions about who truly cares for you."
