  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Oj\u00fa \u00f2 ro\u0301\u0323l\u00e1 r\u00ed; \u00f3 b\u00edm\u1ecd \u00e8\u0323 \u00f3 s\u1ecd o\u0301\u0323 n\u00ed \u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" can be translated to English as \"The face has not seen wealth; it gave birth to a child and named it 'Wealth is troublesome'.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb speaks to the idea that someone who has never experienced wealth or prosperity might have a negative perception of it. The name \"\u1eccl\u00e1n\u00edy\u1ecdnu\" translates to \"Wealth is troublesome\" or \"Wealth brings problems.\" The proverb suggests that because the person has never encountered wealth, they might assume it brings more trouble than benefit, hence naming their child in a way that reflects this belief. It highlights the notion that people often fear or misunderstand what they have not experienced themselves."
