  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\n1) Breaking down the components:\n- \"\u00c0\u00ec-l\u00e1p\u00e1 l\u00e0d\u00e1 \u00f2 m\u00fa\" - The first part seems to say something about lacking strength/arms and a machete not cutting\n- \"b\u00ed a b\u00e1 l\u00e1p\u00e1\" - This means \"if one has strength/arms\"\n- \"\u1ecdm\u1ecd ow\u00fa to-o g\u00e9gi\" - This refers to cotton being able to cut a tree\n\n2) Analyzing key words:\n- \"\u00c0\u00ec-l\u00e1p\u00e1\" = lack of strength/biceps/arms\n- \"l\u00e0d\u00e1 \u00f2 m\u00fa\" = the machete doesn't cut/isn't sharp\n- \"b\u00ed a b\u00e1 l\u00e1p\u00e1\" = if one has strength/arms\n- \"\u1ecdm\u1ecd ow\u00fa\" = cotton (literally \"child of cotton\")\n- \"to-o g\u00e9gi\" = is enough to cut a tree\n\n3) Complete translation:\n\"It's the lack of strength that makes a machete ineffective; if one has strength, even cotton can cut a tree.\"\n\nThe meaning: This proverb teaches that determination, willpower, and effort are more important than tools or circumstances. With enough strength and determination, one can accomplish seemingly impossible tasks. Conversely, even the best tools are useless without proper effort and strength behind them."
