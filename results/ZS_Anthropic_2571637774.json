  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"An elder who doesn't have feet on the ground has wisdom inside.\"\n\nThe proverb suggests that even if an elder appears physically limited or immobile (doesn't have feet on the ground), they still possess valuable wisdom and knowledge. It emphasizes that wisdom comes from experience and age, not physical capabilities, and reminds people to respect and value elders for their mental contributions rather than their physical abilities."
