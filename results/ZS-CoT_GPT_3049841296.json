  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 \u0144g\u00fany\u00e1n, k\u00f2m\u1eb9s\u00e8\u0323 \u00e1 y\u1ecd\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **B\u00ed a b\u00e1**: This phrase means \"when we\" or \"if we.\"\n\n2. **\u0144g\u00fany\u00e1n**: This is a compound word. \"\u0144\" is a present continuous marker, and \"g\u00fany\u00e1n\" means \"pounding yam.\" So, \"\u0144g\u00fany\u00e1n\" translates to \"are pounding yam.\"\n\n3. **k\u00f2m\u1eb9s\u00e8\u0323**: This word means \"the leg of the mortar.\" In the context of pounding yam, it refers to the base or the support of the mortar.\n\n4. **\u00e1 y\u1ecd**: This phrase means \"will shake\" or \"will move.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 \u0144g\u00fany\u00e1n, k\u00f2m\u1eb9s\u00e8\u0323 \u00e1 y\u1ecd\" translates to \"When we are pounding yam, the leg of the mortar will shake.\"\n\nThis proverb conveys the idea that when you are engaged in an activity, especially one that requires effort or causes disturbance, it is natural for there to be some movement or disruption. It can be interpreted as a metaphor for understanding that actions often have consequences or that effort can lead to noticeable changes."
