  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\nFirst, I'll analyze the components:\n- \"A-d\u00e1-m\u00e1-l\u00e8-\u1e63e\" appears to be a name or phrase meaning \"one who cannot do\" or \"one who is incapable\"\n- \"\u00e0d\u00e0b\u00e0\" means \"dove\" or \"pigeon\"\n- \"t\u00ed \u0144d\u00fan b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" refers to the sound the dove makes - \"b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300\" is onomatopoeic for the cooing sound\n\nPutting it together, the literal translation would be something like:\n\"The one-who-cannot-do is like the dove that coos b\u1eb9\u0300m\u0300b\u1eb9\u0300.\"\n\nThe figurative meaning appears to be:\n\"A person who claims inability is like a dove that still manages to coo.\"\n\nThis proverb essentially means that someone who claims they cannot do something but still manages to complain or make noise about it is being hypocritical. It points out the contradiction of someone claiming incapability while still demonstrating some form of ability (like complaining).\n\nEnglish equivalent: \"Actions speak louder than words\" or \"If you have enough energy to complain, you have enough energy to act.\""
