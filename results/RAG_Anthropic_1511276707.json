Such a person chooses the delicate \"iwo\" (a type of food that floats in soup).\n\n2. \"\u1ecc\u0300m\u1ecd\u0300r\u00e0n\" refers to a wise or knowledgeable person who appreciates the cultural significance of kola nuts, which are traditionally valued in Yoruba culture for ceremonies and important occasions.\n\n3. \"M\u00e0r\u00ed-m\u00e0j\u1eb9\" describes someone who lacks discernment or acts impulsively, eating tiger nuts without consideration.\n\nThe deeper meaning is that one's character, wisdom, and discernment determine what one values and chooses in life. It emphasizes the importance of refinement and wisdom in making choices, suggesting that our preferences and what we consume (literally or metaphorically) reveal our character and level of understanding."
