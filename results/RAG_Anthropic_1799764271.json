  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n**Literal Translation:**\n\"A chain that is as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant; the rope that says the elephant should not climb the \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n tree, both the rope and the elephant will go together.\"\n\n**Meaning:**\nThis Yoruba proverb speaks to the futility of attempting to restrain someone or something that is far more powerful than the restraint itself. When a small force tries to restrict a much greater force, the result is that the restraint simply gets carried along with the greater power.\n\n**Cultural Context:**\nThe proverb uses imagery familiar in Yoruba culture - the tall palm tree (\u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9), the mighty elephant (erin), and the \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n tree. It contrasts the seemingly impressive height of a chain with the much greater power of an elephant, showing that even what appears substantial (a chain as tall as a palm tree) is inadequate against true strength.\n\n**Application:**\nThis proverb is used to caution against attempting to control forces beyond one's capacity. It can apply to situations where:\n- Someone tries to restrict a person with much greater influence or power\n- A weak policy or rule is applied to a strong-willed individual\n- Any attempt to limit something using inadequate means\n\nThe wisdom advises understanding the true measure of forces at play before attempting restraint."
