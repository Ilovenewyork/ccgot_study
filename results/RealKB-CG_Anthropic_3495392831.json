  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"O\u00fanj\u1eb9 \u1ecdm\u1ecd k\u00e9ker\u00e9 a m\u00e1a w\u1ecd \u00e0gb\u00e0 n\u00edn\u00fa; \u00f2r\u00f9ka \u1ecdm\u1ecd k\u00e9ker\u00e9 ni k\u00ec \u00ed w\u1ecd \u00e1gb\u00e1 l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00c0 \u0144g\u00e9 e l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301, \u00f3 \u1e3fb\u1ecd \u00f2r\u00f9ka\" translates to \"We are cutting his hand, and he's putting on a ring\" - suggesting someone doing something inappropriate for the situation.\n2. This implies a contrast between size and appropriateness - a ring doesn't belong on a hand being amputated, suggesting improper timing or priorities.\n3. In the main proverb, there's a similar contrast between children and adults with mentions of food (o\u00fanj\u1eb9) and rings (\u00f2r\u00f9ka).\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests the proverb may be about inappropriate actions or mismatched relationships between children and adults, particularly around things that can fit (food entering an adult's body, but a child's ring not fitting an adult's finger).\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A small child's food can enter an adult's stomach; a small child's ring cannot fit on an adult's finger.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eccm\u1ecdd\u00e9 n\u00ed \u1eb9\u1eb9\u0301ta l\u1ecd\u0301w\u1ecd\u0301, \u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00ed \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9 w\u00e1 k\u00e1 \u1e63er\u00e9 ow\u00f3; \u1eb9\u1eb9\u0301ta-\u00e1 ha t\u00f3 \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9\u00fa s\u00fa epo l\u00e1?\" translates roughly to \"A child has three cowries and invites \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9 (a deity) to come play a money game; are three cowries enough for \u00c8\u1e63\u00f9 to buy palm oil?\"\n2. This phrase highlights the disparity between a child's limited resources and an adult deity's needs - suggesting naivety on the child's part.\n3. It reinforces the idea of improper scale or mismatch between what children offer and what adults require.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase emphasizes the mismatch of scale between children and adults, particularly regarding possessions and needs. It suggests the main proverb is about recognizing differences in capacity and scale between generations.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A small child's food can enter an adult's stomach; a small child's ring cannot fit on an adult's finger.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the selective nature of sharing or exchanges between generations. While adults can consume and benefit from what children offer as food (metaphorically including their ideas, contributions, or resources), not everything from children is suitable for adults (like their rings won't fit adult fingers). It teaches humility to adults - they should accept valuable contributions from younger people even while recognizing differences in capacity and experience. It also speaks to the natural limitations in generational exchanges while encouraging openness to what can be shared. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the balanced respect between generations: respecting elders' wisdom while also acknowledging that youth can contribute meaningfully to society.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase warns against inappropriate actions, reinforcing the proverb's lesson about recognizing proper relationships. The second similar phrase highlights the limitations of what children can offer adults, emphasizing the need for realistic expectations in cross-generational exchanges."
