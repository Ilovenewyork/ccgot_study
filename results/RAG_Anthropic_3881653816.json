  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:**\n\"The person who is sold and the money is used to buy a cutlass: he says the cutlass is making him suffer.\"\n\n**Meaning:**\nThis proverb refers to someone who is caught in a situation where they're being harmed by something that came from their own exploitation. It describes a person who was sold into slavery, and the money from that sale was used to purchase a cutlass (machete), which is now being used to make that same person work hard or suffer.\n\n**Explanation:**\nThe proverb illustrates a double injustice - not only was the person sold (exploited), but the proceeds were used to buy a tool that became the instrument of their ongoing suffering. It's often used to describe situations where someone is not only victimized once, but the initial victimization leads to continued hardship for them.\n\nThis proverb teaches about the compounding nature of injustice and is used when commenting on situations where someone suffers multiple consequences from a single unfortunate event."
