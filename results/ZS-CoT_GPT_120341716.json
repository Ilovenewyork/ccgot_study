  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"\u00ccy\u00e0w\u00f3 t\u00f3 na \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u1ecdb\u00e0kan, o\u0300\u0323ro\u0300\u0323 l\u00f3 f\u00e9\u0323 gbo\u0301\u0323\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\u00ccy\u00e0w\u00f3** - This means \"wife\" in English.\n2. **t\u00f3 na** - \"t\u00f3\" is a relative pronoun meaning \"that\" or \"who,\" and \"na\" means \"beat\" or \"spank.\"\n3. **\u1ecdm\u1ecd \u1ecdb\u00e0kan** - \"\u1ecdm\u1ecd\" means \"child,\" and \"\u1ecdb\u00e0kan\" refers to \"another person's child\" or \"someone else's child.\"\n4. **o\u0300\u0323ro\u0300\u0323** - This means \"word\" or \"matter.\"\n5. **l\u00f3 f\u00e9\u0323 gbo\u0301\u0323** - \"l\u00f3\" is a contraction of \"ni \u00f3,\" meaning \"wants to,\" \"f\u00e9\u0323\" means \"wants,\" and \"gbo\u0301\u0323\" means \"hear\" or \"understand.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as: \"A wife who beats someone else's child wants to hear a word (or matter).\" \n\nIn essence, this proverb suggests that when someone takes an action that affects others, they should be prepared to face the consequences or hear what others have to say about it."
