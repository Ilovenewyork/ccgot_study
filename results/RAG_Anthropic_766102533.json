  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Excess is the father of shame; shame is the end result of excess; an elder who wears the garment of excess will end up in shame.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis Yoruba proverb warns against excessiveness or going to extremes in behavior, actions, or lifestyle. It teaches that:\n\n1. Excess (\u00e0\u1e63ej\u00f9) directly leads to shame or disgrace (\u00e0\u1e63et\u1eb9\u0301)\n2. The natural consequence of excessive behavior is embarrassment\n3. Even respected elders (\u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0) who engage in excessive behaviors will ultimately face humiliation\n\nThe proverb emphasizes the universal principle that immoderate actions, regardless of one's status or age, will eventually lead to negative consequences. It promotes moderation, self-control, and dignified conduct as cultural values in Yoruba society.\n\nThis is a cautionary message about maintaining balance and restraint in all aspects of life to preserve one's honor and reputation."
