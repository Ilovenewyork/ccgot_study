It reflects the gender roles in traditional Yoruba culture where men were often considered the ultimate authority in resolving conflicts and making final judgments.\n\nThe proverb uses \"pagbo \u00ecja\" (to settle or conclude a fight) as a metaphor for having the final say or decisive authority in conflict resolution. While women might participate in mediation processes, the final resolution was traditionally seen as the domain of male elders or leaders.\n\nThis proverb is one of many in Yoruba culture that reflects historical gender dynamics and role expectations, though modern interpretations and applications would certainly differ as social norms have evolved."
