  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb can be translated as:\n\n\"A child who has never tasted soup/stew before smears palm oil on their chest.\"\n\nThe proverb refers to someone who lacks experience with something but pretends to be familiar with it or shows off inappropriately. It's about inexperience leading to improper behavior or mistaken actions - similar to the concept of someone who doesn't know the proper way to do something trying to fake their way through it."
