  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"\u00d3 y\u1eb9 \u1eb9ni gbogbo k\u00f3 d\u00ednw\u00f3 ar\u00f3, k\u00f2 y\u1eb9 ato\u0300\u0323o\u0301\u0323l\u00e9\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\u00d3 y\u1eb9 \u1eb9ni gbogbo**: This phrase means \"It is appropriate for everyone\" or \"Everyone should.\"\n\n2. **k\u00f3 d\u00ednw\u00f3 ar\u00f3**: \"k\u00f3\" means \"to,\" \"d\u00ednw\u00f3\" means \"reduce\" or \"lessen,\" and \"ar\u00f3\" refers to \"lamentation\" or \"sorrow.\" So, this part translates to \"reduce lamentation\" or \"lessen sorrow.\"\n\n3. **k\u00f2 y\u1eb9 ato\u0300\u0323o\u0301\u0323l\u00e9**: \"k\u00f2 y\u1eb9\" means \"it is not appropriate\" or \"it is not fitting,\" and \"ato\u0300\u0323o\u0301\u0323l\u00e9\" refers to \"the lazy person\" or \"the indolent.\" Therefore, this part translates to \"it is not appropriate for the lazy person.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated into English as: \"It is appropriate for everyone to lessen sorrow, but not for the lazy person.\" \n\nThis proverb suggests that while everyone should strive to reduce their troubles or burdens, those who are lazy or indolent may not have the same justification or right to do so, as their lack of effort contributes to their situation."
