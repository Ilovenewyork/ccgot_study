  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"Let the slave know themselves as a slave; let the pawn know themselves as a pawn; let the person of good character know themselves as a servant of God the king.\"\n\nThis proverb speaks to self-awareness and understanding one's place and role. It suggests that everyone should recognize their position in life, with the ultimate moral perspective being that a person of good character (\u1ecdm\u1ecdl\u00faw\u00e0b\u00ed) should humbly consider themselves as serving God."
