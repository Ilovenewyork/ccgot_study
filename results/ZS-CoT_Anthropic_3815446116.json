  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the words:\n- \"\u1eb8l\u1eb9\u0301d\u1eb9\u0300\" = pig (or pig owner/keeper)\n- \"\u00f2\" = negative marker (does not)\n- \"m\u1eb9\u0300y\u1eb9\" = know birds\n\nPutting it together literally: \"A pig does not know birds.\"\n\nThe meaning of this proverb is: \"A pig does not recognize birds\" or \"The pig is not familiar with birds.\"\n\nIn terms of its deeper meaning, this proverb suggests that people often lack understanding or appreciation for things outside their own experience or environment. It's used to describe someone who cannot comprehend or value matters beyond their limited knowledge or sphere of existence.\n\nThe English equivalent might be something like \"You can't understand what you've never experienced\" or \"One cannot appreciate what lies outside their own world.\""
