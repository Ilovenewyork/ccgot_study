  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"\u00d2n\u00ed, \u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn, o\u0300\u0323la, \u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn; \u1eb9tu n\u00eckan l\u1eb9ran t\u00f3 w\u00e0 n\u00edgb\u00f3?\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\u00d2n\u00ed, \u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn**: \n   - \"\u00d2n\u00ed\" means \"today.\"\n   - \"\u1eb9t\u00fa\" refers to a type of antelope.\n   - \"j\u00ecnf\u00ecn\" means \"to fall into a pit\" or \"to be trapped.\"\n   - So, this part translates to \"Today, the antelope falls into a pit.\"\n\n2. **o\u0300\u0323la, \u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn**: \n   - \"o\u0300\u0323la\" means \"tomorrow.\"\n   - The rest of the phrase is the same as the first part.\n   - This translates to \"Tomorrow, the antelope falls into a pit.\"\n\n3. **\u1eb9tu n\u00eckan l\u1eb9ran t\u00f3 w\u00e0 n\u00edgb\u00f3?**: \n   - \"\u1eb9tu n\u00eckan\" means \"only the antelope.\"\n   - \"l\u1eb9ran t\u00f3 w\u00e0 n\u00edgb\u00f3\" means \"is it the only animal in the forest?\"\n   - This part translates to \"Is the antelope the only animal in the forest?\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb translates to: \n\"Today, the antelope falls into a pit; tomorrow, the antelope falls into a pit; is the antelope the only animal in the forest?\"\n\nThis proverb is often used to question why the same misfortune repeatedly befalls the same person or thing, suggesting that there are other possibilities or alternatives."
