  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll analyze it step by step:\n\n1) Let me break down the proverb: \"\u1e62e b\u00f3o ti m\u1ecd, \u1eb9l\u1eb9\u0301w\u00e0a \u1e62\u00e0p\u1ecd\u0301n.\"\n\n2) Breaking down the components:\n   - \"\u1e62e b\u00f3o ti m\u1ecd\" - This phrase means something like \"Do as you know\" or \"Act according to your knowledge\"\n   - \"\u1eb9l\u1eb9\u0301w\u00e0a\" - This refers to someone with beauty or someone beautiful\n   - \"\u1e62\u00e0p\u1ecd\u0301n\" - This appears to be a proper name or place\n\n3) Putting the meaning together:\n   The proverb essentially means \"Do as you know how to do, beautiful one of \u1e62\u00e0p\u1ecd\u0301n\" or \"Act according to your knowledge, beauty of \u1e62\u00e0p\u1ecd\u0301n.\"\n\n4) The underlying meaning:\n   This proverb appears to be advising someone to act according to their knowledge or abilities. It suggests that one should perform within their capabilities rather than pretending to know more than they do.\n\nThe English translation would be: \"Act according to your knowledge, beauty of \u1e62\u00e0p\u1ecd\u0301n.\"\n\nThis proverb likely encourages authenticity and honesty about one's abilities rather than pretense."
