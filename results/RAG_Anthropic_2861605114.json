It metaphorically describes someone raised among carnivorous animals (leopard, cat) who has developed a strong preference that cannot be changed. The person has been so thoroughly influenced by their environment that they've developed particular tastes or standards (needing meat in their stew) that they refuse to compromise on.\n\nThe deeper meaning relates to how our background and the influences in our life shape our preferences, standards, and character. It suggests that a person's habits and preferences are deeply ingrained based on their upbringing and environment, and they may be unwilling to settle for less than what they're accustomed to.\n\nThis proverb might be used when describing someone who maintains high standards due to their background or when explaining why someone has particular preferences that seem uncompromising to others."
