The similar phrase roughly translates to \"It is the excessive person who worships beyond the devil's bottom; one who carries sacrifice beyond knows not where to place it.\" This speaks to excess and going beyond reasonable boundaries.\n2. This phrase warns against excess, suggesting there's wisdom in moderation and knowing appropriate limits.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase indicates that Yoruba proverbs often warn against excess or persistence in inappropriate directions. This suggests our main proverb may similarly address persistence that leads to negative outcomes.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Refusing-to-leave kills the mosquito; refusing-to-leave kills the bush rat; refusing-to-leave kills the wildcat.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: Ak\u00fa, nk\u00f2 n\u00ed omitooro-o r\u1eb9\u0300 \u1eb9\u0301 l\u00e1; \u00e0\u00eck\u00fa, nk\u00f2 n\u00ed\u00ed p\u00e8 \u00e9 r\u00e1n n\u00ed\u1e63\u1eb9\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second phrase roughly translates to \"If it dies, I will not lick its sweetness; if it doesn't die, I will not send it on errands.\" This speaks to a neutral stance or disengagement from situations beyond one's control.\n2. It conveys wisdom about knowing when to detach from situations, suggesting that sometimes neither involvement nor expectation is the wisest course.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase reinforces the idea that knowing when to engage or disengage is crucial in Yoruba wisdom. Combined with our main proverb, it suggests that persistent engagement in dangerous situations leads to negative consequences.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Refusing to leave kills the mosquito; refusing to leave kills the bush rat; refusing to leave kills the wildcat.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb teaches about the dangers of staying too long in harmful situations or contexts. It uses a progression of increasingly powerful animals (mosquito, bush rat, wildcat) to show that persistence in danger is perilous regardless of one's strength or status. The wisdom conveyed is that knowing when to retreat or disengage is crucial for survival. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would be used to advise against stubbornness, overstaying one's welcome, or persisting in situations that have become dangerous or unproductive.\n\n- References: The similar phrases reinforce the Yoruba cultural emphasis on moderation, appropriate timing, and strategic disengagement. Like the main proverb, they speak to the wisdom of knowing boundaries and limits.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-k\u00far\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144pa \u1eb9m\u1ecd\u0301n; \u00e0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-k\u00far\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144pa \u00e0f\u00e8; \u00e0-j\u1eb9-\u00ec-k\u00far\u00f2 n\u00ed \u0144pa m\u00e1l\u00e1\u00e0j\u00fa\" translates to \"Refusing to leave kills the mosquito; refusing to leave kills the bush rat; refusing to leave kills the wildcat.\" It teaches that persistence in dangerous situations leads to harm regardless of one's strength or position. In Yoruba wisdom, knowing when to retreat is as important as knowing when to advance."
