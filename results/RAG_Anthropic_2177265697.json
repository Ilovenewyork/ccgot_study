When someone is constantly being carried (metaphorically) or overly assisted, they never develop their own capabilities or self-reliance. In the long run, this excessive dependence becomes harmful to the person themselves.\n\nThe proverb warns against creating situations where people become too dependent on help, as this ultimately prevents their personal growth and self-sufficiency. It encourages allowing people to develop their own skills and resilience by not doing everything for them.\n\nThis wisdom applies to many contexts - from parenting (where overprotection harms a child's development), to workplace mentoring, to community support systems, where the goal should be empowerment rather than creating dependency."
