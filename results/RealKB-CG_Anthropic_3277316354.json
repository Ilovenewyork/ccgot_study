  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00cct\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 t\u00f3 \u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9 k\u00f2 t\u00f3 p\u00e9 k\u00e9rin m\u00e1 l\u1ecd; \u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 p\u00e9 k\u00e9rin m\u00e1 l\u1ecd \u00c0l\u1ecd\u0301, t\u00f2un terin n\u00ed \u0144l\u1ecd.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u1eb8\u0300w\u1ecd\u0300n t\u00f3 t\u00f3 \u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9 \u00f2 t\u00f3-\u00f3 d\u00e1 erin d\u00far\u00f3; \u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n t\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00ed erin m\u00e1 r\u00f2k\u00e8 \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n, t\u00f2un terin n\u00ed \u0144l\u1ecd\" uses similar imagery of restraints (\u1eb9\u0300w\u1ecd\u0300n/chains) that are as tall as a palm tree but still insufficient to stop an elephant.\n2. Both proverbs mention \"\u00ect\u00e0k\u00f9n\" (rope or vine) and \"erin\" (elephant), establishing a contrast between something seemingly strong (a tall rope) and something much stronger (an elephant).\n3. The similar phrase adds the imagery of \"\u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n\" (savannah) which suggests an elephant's natural habitat and movement.\n\nInterim Insight: This proverb appears to use the contrast between a rope's height and an elephant's strength to illustrate the futility of weak restrictions against determined forces. The repeated structure emphasizes that attempting to restrain something beyond your capacity leads to you being dragged along with it.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n\nTranslation: \"A rope as tall as a palm tree is not enough to stop an elephant from going; the rope that says an elephant should not go to Alo, will go along with the elephant.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1ecck\u00f9nrin k\u00ec \u00ed k\u00e9, ak\u1ecd igi k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63oje\" translates to \"A man does not cry, a male tree does not produce sap.\" This proverb speaks to expected behaviors based on inherent nature.\n2. This adds cultural context about Yoruba perceptions of natural order and inherent qualities - just as a male tree naturally doesn't produce sap, certain outcomes are predetermined by nature.\n3. When paired with our main proverb, it suggests that attempting to prevent what is natural or inevitable (like an elephant's movement) is futile - one cannot change the fundamental nature of things.\n\nInterim Insight: The second similar phrase reinforces the idea that trying to prevent something from expressing its natural strength or tendency is futile. The elephant will go where it wants to go because that is its nature, just as a male tree doesn't produce sap.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n\n- Final Translation: \"A rope as tall as a palm tree cannot prevent an elephant from going; the rope that insists an elephant should not go to Alo will end up going along with the elephant.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches about the futility of attempting to restrain forces beyond one's control. In Yoruba culture, the elephant symbolizes great power and unstoppable determination. The palm tree, though tall and significant, represents inadequate restraint. The proverb warns against trying to control what is beyond your capacity, as you may find yourself dragged along instead. It counsels wisdom in recognizing limitations and respecting natural order. The proverb could apply to interpersonal relationships, governance, or any situation where one might overestimate their ability to control powerful forces or determined individuals.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the contrast between attempted restraint (rope/chains) and unstoppable force (elephant). Similar Phrase 2 adds cultural context about natural order and the futility of opposing inherent qualities or tendencies."
