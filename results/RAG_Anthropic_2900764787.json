It uses the practical example of harvesting: when one is harvesting corn (\u1ecdk\u00e0), it's not the appropriate time to simultaneously gather palm kernels (\u1eb9m\u1ecd\u0301).\n\nThe wisdom in this proverb advises against dividing attention between multiple tasks at once, which could lead to inefficiency or poor results in both endeavors. It encourages people to concentrate on one important task and see it through to completion before moving on to another task.\n\nIn Yoruba culture, this proverb might be used to counsel someone who is trying to do too many things at once, or to remind someone to maintain focus on their current priority rather than being distracted by other opportunities or responsibilities."
