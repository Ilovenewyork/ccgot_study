  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"Ol\u00f3b\u00ecnrin kan k\u00ec \u00ed pagbo \u00ecja\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Ol\u00f3b\u00ecnrin kan**: This phrase means \"a woman\" or \"one woman.\" \"Ol\u00f3b\u00ecnrin\" translates to \"woman,\" and \"kan\" means \"one\" or \"a.\"\n\n2. **k\u00ec \u00ed**: This is a negative construction in Yoruba, meaning \"does not\" or \"never.\"\n\n3. **pagbo \u00ecja**: The word \"pagbo\" means \"to separate\" or \"to settle,\" and \"\u00ecja\" means \"fight\" or \"dispute.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb \"Ol\u00f3b\u00ecnrin kan k\u00ec \u00ed pagbo \u00ecja\" translates to \"A woman does not settle a dispute\" or \"One woman does not settle a fight.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that resolving conflicts often requires more than one person's effort or that it may not be traditionally expected for a woman to settle disputes alone."
