In Yoruba culture, the market is a central place of commerce and social interaction, and the \"Mother of the Market\" is a respected figure. The proverb suggests that everyone, like the \"Mother of the Market,\" deserves respect and recognition because everyone has a name and identity. It highlights the idea that no one should be overlooked or disrespected, as everyone has their own significance and role in the community."
