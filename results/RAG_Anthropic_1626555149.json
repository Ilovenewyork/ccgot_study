  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Translation:**\n\"Welcome home\" is not appropriate for the house owner; \"Welcome visitor\" is not appropriate for someone returning from a journey; the person who doesn't greet someone with \"Welcome visitor\" will lose their own \"Welcome home.\"\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis proverb addresses proper greetings and social etiquette in Yoruba culture. It explains that:\n\n1. You don't say \"Welcome home\" (\u1eb8 k\u00fa-ul\u00e9) to someone who is already at home, as it's only appropriate for returning residents.\n\n2. You don't say \"Welcome visitor\" (\u1eb8 k\u00fa at\u00ecb\u00e0) to someone returning from a journey, as they aren't visitors but returning members.\n\n3. Most importantly, the proverb warns that if you fail to properly greet others with appropriate recognition (not greeting visitors as visitors), you'll eventually lose the courtesy of being properly welcomed yourself when you return home.\n\nThe deeper meaning teaches reciprocity in social relationships - how you treat others determines how they'll treat you in return. It emphasizes the importance of using contextually appropriate greetings and showing proper respect according to Yoruba customs."
