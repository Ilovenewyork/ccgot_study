  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1k\u00e9\u0323 k\u00e1 \u1e63\u00ecw\u00ed; a k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00f2 s\u00f9n-\u00f9n k\u00e1 d\u00e1r\u00e0n\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\"A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1k\u00e9\u0323 k\u00e1 \u1e63\u00ecw\u00ed\"**: \n   - \"A k\u00ec \u00ed\" means \"one does not\" or \"it is not done to.\"\n   - \"d\u00e1k\u00e9\u0323\" means \"be silent\" or \"keep quiet.\"\n   - \"k\u00e1 \u1e63\u00ecw\u00ed\" means \"and still speak\" or \"and then talk.\"\n   - Together, this part means \"One does not keep quiet and still speak.\"\n\n2. **\"a k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00f2 s\u00f9n-\u00f9n k\u00e1 d\u00e1r\u00e0n\"**:\n   - \"a k\u00ec \u00ed\" again means \"one does not\" or \"it is not done to.\"\n   - \"w\u00f2 s\u00f9n-\u00f9n\" means \"look at something\" or \"observe.\"\n   - \"k\u00e1 d\u00e1r\u00e0n\" means \"and then be guilty\" or \"and be at fault.\"\n   - Together, this part means \"One does not just look and be guilty.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as:\n\"One does not keep quiet and still speak; one does not just look and be guilty.\"\n\nThis proverb emphasizes the idea that actions and consequences are linked; you cannot claim to have done nothing (like being silent or just looking) and still be responsible for an outcome."
