  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0\u1e63\u00e1 k\u00ec \u00ed r\u00e0 k\u00e1d\u00ec\u1eb9 gb\u00e9 k\u00f2k\u00f2r\u00f2 d\u00e1n\u00ed\" translates to \"The hawk does not carry the chick and leave the insect behind.\" \n\nThis proverb is used to convey the idea that when someone is intent on achieving a goal or obtaining something valuable, they will not settle for something of lesser value. In the context of the hawk, which is a bird of prey, it would naturally go for the more substantial and valuable prey (the chick) rather than something insignificant (the insect). \n\nThe proverb is often used to emphasize the importance of prioritizing significant goals or objectives over trivial matters. It suggests that one should focus on what truly matters and not get distracted by less important things."
