  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed ay\u00e1 b\u00e1 moj\u00fa \u1ecdk\u1ecd, al\u00e1r\u00ecnn\u00e0 a y\u1eb9s\u00e8\u0323\" translates to \"When the wife and husband understand each other, the mediator loses their job.\"\n\nExplanation: This proverb highlights the importance of harmony and understanding in relationships, particularly between a husband and wife. When there is mutual understanding and effective communication between partners, there is no need for a third party or mediator to intervene in their affairs. It emphasizes the value of resolving issues internally and maintaining a strong, direct connection in relationships."
