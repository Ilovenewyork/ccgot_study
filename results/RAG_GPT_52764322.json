It suggests that relying on borrowed items or things that do not truly belong to you can lead to discomfort or problems. The proverb uses the metaphor of clothing to illustrate that what is not inherently yours may not fit well or serve you properly, and can even become a burden. Ultimately, it conveys the idea that what you own or what is genuinely yours is what is most suitable and beneficial for you. It encourages self-reliance and contentment with one's own possessions or circumstances."
