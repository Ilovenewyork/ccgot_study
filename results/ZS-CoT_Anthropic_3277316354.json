  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the key words:\n- \"\u00cct\u00e0k\u00f9n\" = creeping plant/vine/climber\n- \"t\u00f3\" = reach/enough\n- \"\u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9\" = palm tree\n- \"k\u00f2 t\u00f3\" = not enough\n- \"p\u00e9\" = to say\n- \"k\u00e9rin\" = that elephant\n- \"m\u00e1 l\u1ecd\" = should not go\n- \"\u00c0l\u1ecd\u0301\" = a place name\n- \"t\u00f2un terin\" = it and the elephant\n- \"n\u00ed \u0144l\u1ecd\" = are going\n\nPutting it together:\n\"The vine that can reach the top of the palm tree is not enough to stop the elephant from going; the vine that says the elephant should not go to Alo, it and the elephant will go together.\"\n\nThe meaning of this proverb:\nThis proverb speaks about the futility of a small force trying to restrain something much more powerful. Just as a vine cannot hold back an elephant, regardless of how tall it can climb, when a small entity tries to prevent a much stronger force from taking action, it will either fail or be dragged along with the stronger force.\n\nIn English, we might express a similar sentiment with \"You can't hold back the tide\" or \"If you can't beat them, you'll be forced to join them.\""
