The proverb describes a scenario where a landlord, who should typically wait at home to receive rent or meet with tenants, is so impatient that he goes out searching for the tenant - only to encounter them already on their way to him.\n\nThe deeper meaning suggests that:\n1. Patience is rewarded - what you're seeking may already be on its way to you\n2. Rushing can create unnecessary complications or embarrassment\n3. Those in authority (like landlords) should trust in the process and wait for things to come to them in due time\n\nThis proverb is often used to counsel patience and warn against the folly of excessive eagerness, especially when someone is anxiously pursuing what would naturally come to them if they simply waited."
