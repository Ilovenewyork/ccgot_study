In Yoruba culture, this proverb is used to highlight the uncomfortable or awkward feeling that comes when someone enjoys something in the presence of others who clearly desire or need the same thing but have no access to it.\n\nThe proverb speaks to social awareness and sensitivity. It suggests that it is inconsiderate or inappropriate to enjoy privileges, resources, or benefits without acknowledging or sharing with those in need around you. The staring dog represents the person in need who is watching someone else enjoy what they lack.\n\nThis proverb teaches empathy and consideration for others' circumstances, encouraging sharing and social responsibility rather than consuming or enjoying things selfishly while others go without."
