  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"K\u00e1 w\u00ed og\u00fan, k\u00e1 w\u00ed \u1ecdgbo\u0300\u0323n, \u201cNg \u00f2 f\u00e9\u0323, ng \u00f2 gb\u00e0\u201d la\u1e63iw\u00e8r\u00e9 fi \u0144p\u00e8\u0323kun o\u0300\u0323r\u00e0n\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **K\u00e1 w\u00ed og\u00fan**: This part means \"To speak of inheritance\" or \"To discuss inheritance.\"\n\n2. **K\u00e1 w\u00ed \u1ecdgbo\u0300\u0323n**: This translates to \"To speak of wisdom\" or \"To discuss wisdom.\"\n\n3. **\u201cNg \u00f2 f\u00e9\u0323, ng \u00f2 gb\u00e0\u201d**: This phrase means \"I don't want, I won't accept.\"\n\n4. **la\u1e63iw\u00e8r\u00e9 fi \u0144p\u00e8\u0323kun o\u0300\u0323r\u00e0n**: This part means \"is how a fool ends a matter\" or \"is how a fool concludes an issue.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as:\n\"To speak of inheritance, to speak of wisdom, 'I don't want, I won't accept' is how a fool ends a matter.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that a foolish person dismisses important discussions or advice, such as those about inheritance or wisdom, with a stubborn refusal to engage or accept them."
