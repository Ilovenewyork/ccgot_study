  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00c0p\u1ecd\u0301nl\u00e9 ni \"\u0130y\u00e1-a K\u00e1\u00e0\"; \u00ecy\u00e1 kan \u00f2 s\u00ed n\u00ed k\u00e1\u00e0 t\u00ed k\u00f2 l\u00f3r\u00fak\u1ecd.\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: K\u00e0k\u00e0 k\u00ed iga ak\u00e0n \u00f3 pad\u00e0 s\u1eb9h\u00ecn, a k\u00e1n.\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"K\u00e0k\u00e0 k\u00ed iga ak\u00e0n \u00f3 pad\u00e0 s\u1eb9h\u00ecn, a k\u00e1n\" translates roughly to \"Rather than the termite hill retreating, it advances forward\" - suggesting persistence and forward movement despite challenges.\n2. This phrase emphasizes naming, identification, and recognition as important cultural values in Yoruba society.\n3. The reference to \"iga ak\u00e0n\" (termite hill) growing steadily relates to how names and titles accumulate and grow in significance over time.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests persistence and growth, which may relate to how names and titles gain respect and recognition in Yoruba culture, hinting that the main proverb likely concerns naming traditions and respect accorded to maternal figures.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"\u0130y\u00e1-a K\u00e1\u00e0\" (Mother of Reading/Counting) is an honorific title; no mother exists in the community of reading/counting who doesn't have a name/title.\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed a k\u00f2 b\u00e1 t\u00f3 \u00ecy\u00e0-\u00e1 k\u1ecd\u0300 t\u00ed \u00e0 \u0144k\u1ecd\u0300 \u1ecd\u0301, \u00e0j\u1eb9k\u00fan \u00ecy\u00e0 l\u00e0 \u0144j\u1eb9.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second phrase translates approximately to \"If we don't fully learn the lesson being taught, we will suffer endless hardship\" - emphasizing the importance of proper learning and recognition of wisdom.\n2. \"\u00ccy\u00e0-\u00e1 k\u1ecd\u0300\" refers to lessons that life or experience teaches us, which connects to the concept of \"\u0130y\u00e1-a K\u00e1\u00e0\" (mother of reading/education) in our main proverb.\n3. Both phrases emphasize the importance of acknowledging sources of knowledge and wisdom, and showing proper respect.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the idea that recognition of teachers/mothers/sources of knowledge is essential, and failing to properly acknowledge them leads to difficulties. This connects to the main proverb's emphasis on naming and honoring maternal or teaching figures.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The title 'Mother of Education' is an honorific; every mother in the realm of education has her own distinct name/title.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of proper recognition and respect for knowledge-givers, particularly maternal figures. In Yoruba culture, names and titles are deeply significant and confer identity and honor. The proverb suggests that those who impart knowledge (symbolized by mothers who teach reading/counting) deserve specific recognition through proper titles. It reflects the Yoruba value system where proper acknowledgment of elders, teachers, and knowledge-bearers is essential. The proverb may be used when advocating for proper attribution, respect for intellectual contributions, or honoring those who educate others.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase about the termite hill suggests steady growth and advancement, similar to how respect and recognition accumulate. The second phrase about learning lessons properly reinforces the importance of acknowledging those who teach us, lest we suffer from ignorance.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0p\u1ecd\u0301nl\u00e9 ni '\u0130y\u00e1-a K\u00e1\u00e0'; \u00ecy\u00e1 kan \u00f2 s\u00ed n\u00ed k\u00e1\u00e0 t\u00ed k\u00f2 l\u00f3r\u00fak\u1ecd\" means that every mother who teaches (reading, counting, or knowledge) deserves proper recognition through a specific name or title. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the deep respect for knowledge-givers and the importance of properly acknowledging their contributions. The proverb teaches us that we should always give proper credit and respect to those who educate us, as names and titles are not merely labels but convey honor and recognition of one's significance in society."
