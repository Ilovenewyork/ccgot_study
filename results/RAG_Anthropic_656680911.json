It suggests that an elder who knowingly disregards proper etiquette toward someone in power is essentially bringing trouble upon themselves - metaphorically preparing for their own funeral.\n\n**Cultural context:** In Yoruba culture, respecting hierarchies and showing proper deference to authority figures is extremely important. Elders especially are expected to model proper behavior and social protocols. The proverb highlights that even those of high status (elders) are not exempt from showing respect to those in positions of power (the Aare/chief).\n\n**Application:** The proverb can be used to caution someone against unnecessary defiance of authority or deliberate disregard for social norms that might lead to serious negative consequences."
