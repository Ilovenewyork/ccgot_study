  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to:\n\n\"The size of the rat determines the size of the trap; a cat does not carry what is too heavy for it.\"\n\nThe meaning conveys that one should operate within one's capacity or means. It suggests that people should take on responsibilities or burdens that match their abilities, just as a trap is built to match the size of the rat it aims to catch, and a cat will not attempt to carry what is too heavy for it."
