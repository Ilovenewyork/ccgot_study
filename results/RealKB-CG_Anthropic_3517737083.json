  "gen": "# Translation and Interpretation of a Yoruba Proverb\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: Aaka \u00f2 gb\u00e9 \u1ecd\u0300d\u00e0n; igb\u00f3 n\u00ed \u0144gb\u00e9.\n(The vine does not support the savanna; it's the forest that supports it.)\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This similar phrase speaks to natural order and appropriate environments - each thing has its place and context where it thrives.\n2. It suggests that elements work properly in their rightful place, implying that proper function depends on accepting one's natural role or position.\n3. The imagery contrasts the savanna (open space) with the forest (structured ecosystem) - suggesting ordered systems versus chaos.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase establishes a context of natural order and the importance of accepting the proper nature of things rather than rejecting established wisdom.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One may speak of inheritance, one may speak of wisdom, but 'I don't want it, I won't accept it' is how a fool ends a matter.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: K\u00ed ni or\u00ed \u0144\u1e63e t\u00ed \u00e8j\u00eck\u00e1 \u00f2 l\u00e8 \u1e63e? \u00c8j\u00eck\u00e1 ru \u1eb9r\u00f9 \u00f3 gba \u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301d\u00fanr\u00fan; or\u00ed ta ti\u1eb9\u0300 n\u00ed og\u00fanl\u00fagba.\n(What can the head do that the shoulders cannot? The shoulders carry loads worth five hundred cowries; the head sells its own for just twenty.)\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase contrasts the head (representing thinking/wisdom) with shoulders (representing physical strength/labor).\n2. It suggests that wisdom (the head) is actually more valuable than mere physical capability, despite appearances.\n3. The numerical values (500 vs. 20) create irony - what seems more capable (shoulders) is actually less valuable than wisdom (the head).\n\nInterim Insight: This adds the dimension that rejecting wisdom (as in the main proverb) is foolish because wisdom is ultimately more valuable than stubborn resistance or physical strength.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One may offer inheritance, one may offer wisdom, but 'I don't want it, I won't accept it' is how a fool ends a matter.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb criticizes the foolishness of rejecting advice, wisdom, or beneficial legacies out of stubbornness or pride. In Yoruba culture, wisdom (\u1ecdgb\u1ecdn) and inheritance/tradition (og\u00fan) are valued resources that contribute to success and well-being. The proverb teaches that only a fool would summarily dismiss these valuable resources without consideration. Just as the vine needs the forest (Similar Phrase 1), people need to accept and work within established wisdom. And just as the head's wisdom exceeds the shoulders' strength in value (Similar Phrase 2), accepting guidance and inheritance brings greater benefit than stubborn rejection. The proverb ultimately cautions against the pride and close-mindedness that leads people to reject beneficial counsel.\n\n- References: The interpretation draws on the ecological harmony referenced in Similar Phrase 1 and the value hierarchy established in Similar Phrase 2 to explain why rejecting wisdom and inheritance is considered foolish in Yoruba thought."
