  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"K\u00ed ni D\u00e1\u00e0r\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f3 t\u00f3 s\u1ecd p\u00e9 ol\u00e8-\u00e9 k\u00f3 \u00f2un?\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"A \u00f2 m\u1ecd ohun t\u00ed D\u00e1r\u00f2-\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f3 t\u00f3 w\u00ed p\u00e9 ol\u00e8-\u00e9 k\u00f3 \u00f2un\" translates roughly to \"We don't know what Daro said before claiming that he was robbed.\"\n2. This suggests the proverb is about someone (D\u00e1\u00e0r\u00f3) who claims to be a victim (of theft) but we don't know the full story or what preceded this claim.\n3. The phrase implies skepticism about someone's account of events - specifically questioning what happened before they made their accusation or claim.\n\nInterim Insight: This proverb appears to be about questioning the credibility of someone's claims, particularly when they present themselves as a victim without providing context of what happened before.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"What did Daaro say before claiming that he was robbed?\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The second phrase about the tortoise (\u00c0j\u00e0p\u00e1) translates approximately to \"The tortoise says nothing is like what we already know how to do; he says if he puts an egg in his mouth, he will spit out palm kernel.\"\n2. This Yoruba phrase illustrates how someone might make implausible claims about their abilities or experiences.\n3. The tortoise is a common character in Yoruba folktales who often represents cunning, deception, and making false claims.\n4. This connects to the Daaro proverb by highlighting how people may make dubious claims without evidence or logical background.\n\nInterim Insight: Both phrases deal with credibility and the gap between claims and reality. The tortoise example reinforces that the Daaro proverb is about questioning suspicious claims that don't align with what we know to be possible or true.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- **Final Translation:** \"What did Daaro say before claiming that he was robbed?\"\n\n- **Culturally-Grounded Interpretation:** This Yoruba proverb encourages critical thinking and skepticism toward one-sided accounts. It suggests we should question what preceded someone's claim of victimhood, as they may have omitted important context that changes how we interpret the situation. In Yoruba culture, this proverb would be invoked when someone appears to be presenting themselves as a victim while potentially hiding their own role or provocation in the matter. It warns against accepting accusations at face value without understanding the full sequence of events.\n\n- **References:** The first similar phrase reinforces the proverb's skepticism about incomplete narratives. The second phrase about the tortoise connects to Yoruba oral traditions where the tortoise (\u00c0j\u00e0p\u00e1) frequently makes implausible claims, teaching listeners to question extraordinary claims that lack supporting evidence."
