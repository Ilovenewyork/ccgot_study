Together, \"al\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd-kan\" means \"a person with only one cloth\" or \"someone with just one garment.\"\n\n2. **k\u00ec \u00ed**: This is a negative construction in Yoruba, meaning \"does not\" or \"will not.\"\n\n3. **n\u00e1**: This means \"wear out\" or \"become worn out.\"\n\n4. **\u00e0n\u00e1r\u1eb9**: This refers to \"in a day\" or \"in one day.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb \"Al\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd-kan k\u00ec \u00ed n\u00e1 \u00e0n\u00e1r\u1eb9\" translates to \"A person with only one cloth does not wear it out in one day.\"\n\nThe proverb conveys the idea of resourcefulness and careful management. It suggests that even if you have limited resources, with careful use and management, they can last longer than expected."
