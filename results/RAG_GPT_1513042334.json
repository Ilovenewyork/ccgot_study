  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e1k\u00e9\u0323 k\u00e1 \u1e63\u00ecw\u00ed; a k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00f2 s\u00f9n-\u00f9n k\u00e1 d\u00e1r\u00e0n\" can be translated to English as \"One does not keep silent and still speak; one does not look and still miss the way.\"\n\nThis proverb emphasizes the importance of consistency and the logical sequence of actions. It suggests that certain actions or states are mutually exclusive. For example, if you are silent, you cannot be speaking at the same time, and if you are looking carefully, you should not miss your way. The proverb advises against contradictory behavior and highlights the need for coherence in one's actions and decisions. It serves as a reminder to be mindful and deliberate in our actions to avoid confusion and mistakes."
