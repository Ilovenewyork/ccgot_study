  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step:\n\n1) Let me analyze the components of the proverb:\n   - \"A-lu-d\u00f9nd\u00fan\" refers to someone who plays or beats the d\u00f9nd\u00fan (a type of talking drum in Yoruba culture)\n   - \"k\u00ec \u00ed\" is a negative marker meaning \"does not\" or \"cannot\"\n   - \"d\u00e1rin\" means \"to compose a song\" or \"to start/initiate music\"\n\n2) The literal translation would be: \"The dundun drummer does not compose the song.\"\n\n3) Understanding the cultural context: In Yoruba musical tradition, the drummer (especially of the talking drum) is typically responsible for following the lead of the singer or responding to the melody, not creating the original composition.\n\n4) The meaning of the proverb: This proverb expresses that everyone has their role in a process. The person who implements or executes something is not necessarily the one who should conceive or initiate it.\n\nEnglish translation: \"The drummer of the dundun does not compose the song.\"\n\nCultural equivalent meaning: \"The executor is not the originator\" or \"The implementer is not the creator.\""
