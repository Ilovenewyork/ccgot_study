  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n## Translation\n\"I am full\" says \"I am full,\" \"I refuse\" says \"I refuse\"; to eat alone is the behavior of an elderly greedy person.\n\n## Explanation\nThis proverb criticizes selfishness and greed, particularly among those who should know better due to their age or position. It portrays someone eating alone while making excuses like \"I am full\" or \"I refuse\" to avoid sharing food with others.\n\nIn Yoruba culture, sharing food is a fundamental social value that demonstrates generosity and community spirit. The proverb condemns those who eat in isolation and use false excuses to avoid sharing with others. The reference to an elderly person (\u00e0gb\u00e0) makes the criticism more pointed, as elders are expected to model proper behavior in the community.\n\nThis proverb would typically be used to admonish someone who is being selfish with their resources or to warn against the social consequences of greed and self-centeredness."
