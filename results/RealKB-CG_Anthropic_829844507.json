The similar phrase \"Or\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0-\u00e1 n\u00edy\u00ec, \u00f3 s\u00e0n ju or\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0-\u00e1 f\u1ecd\u0301 l\u1ecd\" translates to \"The elder's head is respected/honored, it is better than the elder's head being broken.\"\n2. This phrase emphasizes respect for elders and suggests that preserving an elder's dignity is better than seeing them dishonored or harmed.\n3. Both phrases use the comparative structure \"\u00f3 s\u00e0n ju... l\u1ecd\" (it is better than...), suggesting the original proverb also compares two states involving elders.\n4. Both phrases appear to address the proper treatment and dignity of elders in Yoruba culture.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely contrasts two possible conditions for elders, with one being preferable to the other from a cultural perspective of dignity and respect.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The day an elder dies is better than the day an elder is disgraced/humiliated.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The second similar phrase \"B\u00ed \u1ecdj\u00e0\u00e1 b\u00e1 t\u00fa t\u00e1n, a ku ol\u00f3r\u00ed-i p\u00e0t\u1eb9p\u00e0t\u1eb9, a ku \u00e0gb\u00e0\u00e0gb\u00e0 s\u00e0-\u01f9k\u00f2 s\u00e0-\u01f9k\u00f2 l\u1ecd\u0301j\u00e0; b\u00cdf\u00e1 b\u00e1 p\u1eb9\u0300d\u00ed t\u00e1n, \u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300-\u01f9w\u1ecd\u0300 a d\u00ecde\" roughly translates to \"When the market disperses, we salute the chiefs respectfully, we salute the elders scattered throughout the market; when Ifa divination is completed, people stand up.\"\n2. This phrase highlights the cultural practices of showing respect to elders and authority figures even in everyday settings like marketplaces.\n3. It reinforces the importance of maintaining social hierarchies and proper protocols of respect in Yoruba society.\n4. The phrase demonstrates how respect for elders is woven into daily activities and social interactions.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase adds context about how elders are positioned in Yoruba society - they are to be acknowledged with respect in all settings. This helps us understand why disgrace would be considered worse than death in our original proverb.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It is better for an elder to die than to be disgraced.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb reflects the profound Yoruba cultural value placed on dignity, honor, and respect, particularly for elders. In Yoruba culture, elders are repositories of wisdom, guardians of tradition, and embodiments of ancestral connection. The proverb suggests that death, which is a natural end to life, is preferable to living with shame or disgrace that destroys one's dignity and social standing. This sentiment underscores how seriously Yoruba culture takes matters of honor and shame - death itself is considered less severe than the social death that comes with disgrace. The proverb teaches that preserving one's integrity and dignity until death is among the highest virtues.\n- References: The first similar phrase reinforces the importance of respecting elders' dignity above all else. The second similar phrase demonstrates how respect for elders is deeply embedded in daily Yoruba social interactions."
