  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the components:\n- \"Ol\u00f3b\u00ecnrin\" means \"woman\" or \"a woman\"\n- \"kan\" means \"one\" or \"a single\"\n- \"k\u00ec \u00ed\" is a negative marker meaning \"does not\" or \"cannot\"\n- \"pa\" means \"to kill\" or \"to finish\"\n- \"agbo\" means \"herd\" or \"group\"\n- \"\u00ecja\" means \"fight\" or \"quarrel\"\n\nPutting these together literally: \"A single woman cannot end/finish a group/herd of fights.\"\n\nThe meaning of this proverb is: \"A single woman cannot resolve all disputes\" or more idiomatically, \"One woman cannot settle all quarrels.\"\n\nThe proverb essentially conveys that some problems or disputes are too large or complex for one person to resolve alone, particularly emphasizing that even with a woman's traditionally recognized role in mediation and peacekeeping in Yoruba culture, there are limits to what one person can accomplish."
