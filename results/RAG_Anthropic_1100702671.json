The buttocks, by their natural design, maintain their shape regardless of how long or how often one sits. They don't flatten permanently despite constant pressure.\n\nThe proverb metaphorically means that some things retain their essential nature despite external pressures. It speaks to natural resilience and the idea that certain fundamental characteristics cannot be permanently altered.\n\nIn practical application, this proverb might be used to:\n- Suggest that people's true character or nature will eventually reveal itself\n- Indicate that some problems or issues will persist despite attempts to suppress them\n- Emphasize that some traditions or cultural practices endure despite modernization\n- Remind people that certain realities cannot be changed no matter how much one tries\n\nThe proverb shares meaning with the others you listed which appear to deal with permanence, proper positioning, and respect for natural order."
