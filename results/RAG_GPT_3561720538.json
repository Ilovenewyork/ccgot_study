  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Ta n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9un t\u00e1j\u00e1 \u0144j\u00f9r\u00f9?\" translates to \"Who is eating that the dog is wagging its tail?\" in English.\n\nThis proverb is used to highlight the idea that actions or behaviors often have underlying causes or motivations. In this context, the wagging of the dog's tail is a visible sign that something is happening, specifically that someone is eating. It suggests that when you see a reaction or a result, there is usually a reason behind it. The proverb encourages people to look beyond the surface and consider the underlying factors or causes of a situation."
