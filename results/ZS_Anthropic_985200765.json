  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"I know him completely\" is how Death carries away a man.\n\nThis proverb suggests that death comes when it believes it fully understands or has the measure of a person. It speaks to the inevitability of death and perhaps implies that death comes when one's time is truly up, not before. The proverb personifies Death (Or\u00f2) as an entity that makes deliberate decisions about when to take someone's life."
