  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eccm\u1ecd \u00e0\u00ec-j\u1ecdb\u00e8\u0323-r\u00ed t\u00ed \u0144ja epo s\u00e1y\u00e0\" translates to \"A child who has never tasted soup is scooping palm oil into their pocket.\"\n\nThis proverb is used to describe someone who is inexperienced or naive, yet they are acting in a way that suggests they are knowledgeable or capable. It highlights the irony of someone who lacks understanding or experience trying to handle a situation that is beyond their grasp. The imagery of a child putting palm oil in their pocket suggests a lack of awareness of the consequences, as the oil will obviously stain and ruin the pocket, just as inexperience can lead to mistakes or problems."
