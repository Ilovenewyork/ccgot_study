The similar phrase translates roughly to \"A diviner (babal\u00e1wo) won't be so hungry/desperate that he asks about yesterday's sacrifice.\" This suggests a theme about maintaining dignity despite desperation.\n2. \"Oj\u00fa p\u1ecd\u0301n\" refers to a state of hunger, desperation, or being in dire straits. In both proverbs, it suggests a threshold that shouldn't be crossed despite difficult circumstances.\n3. The babal\u00e1wo (diviner) in the similar phrase occupies a position of respect, similar to the \"ba\u00e1l\u00e9\" (head of household) in our target proverb.\n4. Both proverbs seem to address maintaining one's dignity and proper role despite hardship.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely addresses the importance of maintaining dignity and proper social roles even in difficult times. There are certain actions that would be beneath one's status regardless of desperation.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The head of the household won't be so desperate/hungry that he sweeps his own house with his hands.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: Oj\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed p\u1ecd\u0301n \u1eb9dun k\u00f3 d\u1eb9ni il\u1eb9\u0300; \u00ec\u1e63\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00ec \u00ed \u1e63\u1eb9\u0301 ig\u00fan k\u00f3 di oj\u00fagb\u00e0 ad\u00ec\u1eb9.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This phrase translates approximately to \"A monkey won't be so hungry that it descends to the ground; a vulture won't be so hungry that it becomes a chicken's equal.\" This reinforces the theme of maintaining one's natural position despite hardship.\n2. The phrase uses animal symbolism to convey how certain creatures maintain their natural position despite hunger or desperation.\n3. Like the target proverb, it emphasizes boundaries and maintaining proper place in a hierarchy.\n4. This adds the cultural context that in Yoruba society, there are natural orders and hierarchies that should be respected even when circumstances are difficult.\n\nInterim Insight: The target proverb specifically addresses roles within the household and social hierarchy. In traditional Yoruba culture, certain tasks were assigned to specific people based on status, and violating these norms would be seen as degrading one's dignity and status.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The head of the household won't be so desperate or hungry that he sweeps his own house with his hands.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining social hierarchy and dignity regardless of circumstances. In traditional Yoruba society, the head of the household (ba\u00e1l\u00e9) holds a position of respect and authority. Certain menial tasks like sweeping would typically be done by others in the household. The proverb teaches that even in difficult times, one should maintain dignity appropriate to one's station. It speaks to the broader cultural value of preserving social order and the proper roles assigned to different members of society. The proverb cautions against compromising one's status and dignity even when facing hardship.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces this by showing how a diviner (another respected position) maintains dignity despite hunger. Similar Phrase 2 uses animal imagery to show how creatures maintain their natural position in the hierarchy of life regardless of difficulties.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"Oj\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed p\u1ecd\u0301n ba\u00e1l\u00e9 il\u00e9 k\u00f3 f\u1ecdw\u1ecd\u0301 gb\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300 il\u00e9 \u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"The head of the household won't be so desperate or hungry that he sweeps his own house with his hands.\" It reflects the Yoruba cultural emphasis on maintaining proper social roles and personal dignity regardless of circumstances.
