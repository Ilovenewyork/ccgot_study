  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0f\u00f2pin\u00e1 t\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 pa f\u00ect\u00edl\u00e0, ara \u00e8\u0323 ni y\u00f3 pa\" translates to \"The firefly that says it will extinguish the lamp will extinguish itself.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb uses the imagery of a firefly, a small insect that emits light, claiming it can put out a lamp, which is a much larger and more powerful source of light. The message here is about overestimating one's abilities or taking on a task that is beyond one's capacity. It suggests that when someone attempts to do something beyond their power or capability, they are more likely to harm themselves or fail in the process. It serves as a caution against arrogance and encourages self-awareness and humility."
