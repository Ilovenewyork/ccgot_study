Both proverbs start with \"\u00c0gb\u00e0\" (elder), indicating they speak to the expected standards for elders in Yoruba society.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb emphasizes the inconsistency of an elder who maintains cleanliness (washing hands) but then contradicts this proper behavior with an improper claim or action (saying they'll eat with dirty hands anyway).\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"An elder doesn't finish washing their hands and then claim they will eat with dirty hands.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to the importance of consistency in character and actions, especially for elders who should exemplify wisdom. It criticizes hypocrisy and self-contradiction, particularly when someone does something right (washing hands) but then undermines it with contradictory words or actions. In Yoruba culture, elders are expected to be role models and demonstrate wisdom through consistent behavior. The proverb can be applied to situations where people contradict their own positive actions with inappropriate claims or behaviors, teaching that integrity requires alignment between our actions and words.\n\n- References: Both similar phrases reinforce Yoruba cultural values regarding proper behavior, particularly for elders. The first phrase addresses self-deception, while the second emphasizes elders' responsibility to maintain proper standards. Together, they frame the proverb within the broader Yoruba ethical framework of wisdom, consistency, and integrity.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed w\u1eb9w\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1n k\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 j\u1eb9 si\" translates to \"An elder doesn't finish washing their hands and then claim they will eat with dirty hands.\" It teaches that we should maintain consistency between our actions and words, especially those in positions of wisdom or authority.
