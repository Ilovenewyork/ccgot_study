  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"O\u00f2r\u00f9n, k\u00f3 t\u00ec\u1eb9 wo\u0300\u0323 k\u00e1 m\u00e1 b\u00e0\u00e1 \u1ecclo\u0301\u0323jo\u0301\u0323 w\u00ed\" translates to \"Sun, set so that we do not blame the owner of the day\" in English.\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb is a metaphorical expression that emphasizes the importance of allowing natural processes to take their course without interference or undue haste. The \"sun\" represents a natural or inevitable process, and \"the owner of the day\" symbolizes someone in charge or responsible for the situation. The proverb suggests that we should be patient and let things unfold in their own time, rather than rushing or forcing outcomes, which could lead to unnecessary blame or conflict. It teaches the value of patience and understanding in dealing with situations beyond our control."
