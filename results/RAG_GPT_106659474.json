  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa w\u1ecd \u1ecdj\u00e0 \u00f3 r\u00ecn gb\u1eb9nd\u00e9\u0323k\u1eb9 o\u0300\u0323b\u00fan w\u1ecd \u1ecdj\u00e0 \u00f3 r\u00ecn \u1e63\u00f9\u00e8\u0323\u1e63\u00f9\u00e8\u0323; o\u0300\u0323b\u00f9n n\u00ed \u00f3 ru \u1eb9r\u00f9 af\u00ednj\u00fa rel\u00e9\" can be translated to English as:\n\n\"A dandy enters the market walking elegantly, a rough person enters the market walking clumsily; it is the rough person who carries the dandy's load home.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis proverb highlights the contrast between appearances and practical abilities. The \"dandy\" (af\u00ednj\u00fa) represents someone who is concerned with appearances and elegance, while the \"rough person\" (o\u0300\u0323b\u00fan) represents someone who may not be as concerned with appearances but is practical and capable. The proverb suggests that while the dandy may look impressive, it is the rough person who ends up doing the actual work or heavy lifting. It serves as a reminder that appearances can be deceiving and that true value often lies in practicality and capability rather than mere outward appearance."
