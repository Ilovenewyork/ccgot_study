  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"When we are arranging corn, we do not arrange palm kernels alongside it.\"\n\nThe proverb essentially means that different things should be handled differently according to their nature. It teaches that we should use appropriate methods and approaches for different situations, people, or tasks rather than applying the same treatment to everything. Things that are fundamentally different require different handling."
