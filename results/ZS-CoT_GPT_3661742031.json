  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"K\u00ed ni D\u00e1\u00e0r\u00f3 n\u00ed k\u00f3 t\u00f3 s\u1ecd p\u00e9 ol\u00e8-\u00e9 k\u00f3 \u00f2un?\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **K\u00ed ni**: This phrase means \"What is\" or \"What did\" in English.\n\n2. **D\u00e1\u00e0r\u00f3**: This is a Yoruba name, often used to refer to a person in proverbs or stories. It doesn't have a direct translation but is used here as a character.\n\n3. **n\u00ed k\u00f3 t\u00f3**: This phrase means \"before\" or \"prior to.\"\n\n4. **s\u1ecd p\u00e9**: This means \"say that\" or \"claim that.\"\n\n5. **ol\u00e8-\u00e9**: This means \"the thief.\"\n\n6. **k\u00f3 \u00f2un**: This means \"stole from him\" or \"took his belongings.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated to English as: \"What did D\u00e1\u00e0r\u00f3 have before he claimed that the thief stole from him?\"\n\nThis proverb is often used to question the validity of someone's claim of being wronged, especially when there is doubt about whether they had anything of value to be taken in the first place."
