  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"After discussing twenty points, after discussing thirty points, 'I don't want it, I don't accept it' is how a fool ends a matter.\"\n\nThe proverb criticizes stubborn refusal to compromise or engage with reason. It suggests that regardless of how many valid points or arguments (twenty or thirty) are presented, a foolish person simply refuses to listen or accept them, abruptly ending the discussion without proper consideration."
