  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \u201cE\u0323 k\u00fa-ul\u00e9\u201d \u00f2 y\u1eb9 ar\u00e1 il\u00e9; \u201cE\u0323 k\u00fa at\u00ecb\u00e0\u201d \u00f2 y\u1eb9ni t\u00ed \u0144t\u00e0j\u00f2 bo\u0300\u0323; \u1eb9ni t\u00ed \u00f2 k\u00ed \u1eb9ni, \u201cK\u00fa at\u00ecb\u00e0\u201d-\u00e1 p\u00e0d\u00e1n\u00f9 \u201cE\u0323 k\u00fa-ul\u00e9.\u201d can be translated and explained as follows:\n\nTranslation:\n\"\u2018Welcome home\u2019 is not appropriate for a resident; \u2018Well done for your effort\u2019 is not suitable for someone who is hiding; the person who does not greet others with \u2018Well done for your effort\u2019 will miss out on being greeted with \u2018Welcome home.\u2019\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb emphasizes the importance of appropriate greetings and the reciprocal nature of social interactions. It suggests that certain greetings or acknowledgments are context-specific and should be used appropriately. For instance, saying \"Welcome home\" to someone who already lives there is unnecessary, just as saying \"Well done for your effort\" to someone who is not actively participating or contributing is inappropriate.\n\nThe proverb also highlights the idea of reciprocity in social relationships. If you do not acknowledge or greet others appropriately, you may not receive the same courtesy in return. It underscores the importance of being considerate and mindful in social interactions, as failing to do so can lead to missed opportunities for connection and mutual respect."
