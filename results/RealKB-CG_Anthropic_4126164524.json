The similar phrase \"K\u00ed ni el\u00e9w\u00e9-e-gb\u00e9gb\u00e9 \u0144t\u00e0 t\u00ed \u00f3 \u0144s\u1ecd p\u00e9 \u1ecdj\u00e0 \u00f2 t\u00e0?\" translates to \"What is the seller of gb\u00e9gb\u00e9 leaves selling that makes them claim the market isn't profitable?\"\n2. This phrase highlights irony and contradiction - someone complaining about poor sales while selling something that actually has value.\n3. It points to the theme of failing to recognize or appreciate what is available to you.\n4. There's an element of ingratitude or unreasonable rejection of what's being offered.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with the rejection of something beneficial without good reason, possibly highlighting ingratitude or poor judgment.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Your younger sibling is sewing clothes for you, you say you don't patronize the seller of ekuru (bean cake); who then patronizes the seller of akara (fried bean cake)?\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eb8\u0300gb\u1ecd\u0301n \u1e63\u00edw\u00e1j\u00fa \u00f3 so a\u1e63\u1ecd k\u1ecd\u0301; \u00e0b\u00far\u00f2-\u00f3 k\u1eb9\u0301h\u00ecn \u00f3 w\u1eb9\u0300w\u00f9; b\u00ed a \u00f2 m\u1ecd\u0300l\u1eb9, \u1ecd\u0300l\u1eb9 \u00f2 m\u1ecd araa r\u1eb9\u0300?\" translates to \"The elder sibling in front ties cloth; the younger sibling behind wears gown; if we don't recognize laziness, does laziness not recognize itself?\"\n2. This phrase emphasizes family relationships and responsibilities - how elder and younger siblings should behave toward each other.\n3. It suggests that roles and contributions within family structures should be acknowledged and respected.\n4. There's an element of accountability and self-awareness in familial relationships.\n\nInterim Insight: This second phrase reinforces that our proverb likely addresses familial relationships, specifically the proper acknowledgment of help and support from family members, and the importance of appreciating what relatives do for us.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Your younger sibling is sewing clothes for you, yet you claim you don't patronize the seller of ekuru (bean cake); who then patronizes the seller of akara (fried bean cake)?\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes ingratitude and the failure to appreciate help from close relations. It points out the contradiction of rejecting assistance from someone close to you (your younger sibling) while claiming you don't support certain people. Ekuru and akara are both bean-based foods, with akara generally being more popular than ekuru. The proverb uses this food comparison to highlight the absurdity of the situation - if you won't even accept help from your own family (analogous to not buying from the ekuru seller), then who would you accept help from (who would buy from the akara seller)? In Yoruba culture, family bonds and reciprocal support are highly valued, and this proverb serves as a reminder to appreciate and acknowledge the contributions of family members, especially when they go out of their way to help you.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase highlights the irony of rejecting something of value, while the second reinforces the importance of recognizing and respecting familial roles and contributions."
