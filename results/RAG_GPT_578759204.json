  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Mo d\u00e0gb\u00e0 mo d\u00e0g\u00f3, ar\u00e9 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 \u00f2 t\u00e1n l\u00f3j\u00fa\u00f9 mi\" can be translated to English as \"I have grown old and matured, yet the playfulness of childhood is not lost on me.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb reflects the idea that no matter how much one ages or matures, there is still a part of them that retains the innocence, curiosity, or playfulness of childhood. It suggests that growing older does not necessarily mean losing one's youthful spirit or sense of wonder. The proverb emphasizes the importance of maintaining a balance between maturity and the joyful, carefree aspects of being young."
