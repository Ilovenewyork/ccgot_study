The similar phrase \"\u00c0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed w\u00e0 l\u1ecd\u0301j\u00e0 k\u00f3r\u00ed \u1ecdm\u1ecd titun w\u1ecd\u0301\" translates to \"An elder should not be present in the marketplace and allow a child's head to be improperly positioned/wrapped.\" This speaks to the responsibility of elders to guide and correct younger ones.\n2. This suggests a theme of dignity, responsibility, and proper social conduct expected from elders in Yoruba society.\n3. The original proverb appears to also address the behavior or situation of an elderly person, suggesting something potentially embarrassing or undignified.\n\nInterim Insight: Both proverbs seem to address expectations of elderly behavior, suggesting there are certain standards elders must maintain to preserve their dignity and respect in society.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Providing a literal English translation of the proverb.\n\nTranslation: \"An elderly person who puts fermented guinea corn into a calabash of banana is embarrassed/ashamed.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: In\u00fa bur\u00fak\u00fa l\u00e0gb\u00e0 \u0144n\u00ed, \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed n\u00ed oj\u00fa bur\u00fak\u00fa.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explaining how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"In\u00fa bur\u00fak\u00fa l\u00e0gb\u00e0 \u0144n\u00ed, \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00ec \u00ed n\u00ed oj\u00fa bur\u00fak\u00fa\" translates to \"An elder may have a bad stomach (internal feelings), but an elder should not have a bad face (external expression).\" This speaks to the expectation that elders maintain composure and dignity outwardly regardless of internal struggles.\n2. This reinforces the idea that elders are held to higher standards of public conduct and decorum in Yoruba society.\n3. The original proverb about mixing fermented guinea corn with banana suggests an inappropriate or foolish action that brings shame to an elder, violating these standards of dignified behavior.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb appears to be cautioning against actions that bring public shame to elders, reinforcing the cultural expectation that age comes with responsibility to maintain dignity and avoid embarrassing situations.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"An elderly person who mixes fermented guinea corn into a calabash of bananas feels ashamed.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb speaks to the expectations placed on elders in Yoruba society. It uses the imagery of inappropriately mixing foods (which would be considered foolish or wasteful) to illustrate how elders should avoid undignified or inappropriate behaviors that would bring them shame. In Yoruba culture, elders are expected to be repositories of wisdom and models of proper conduct. When they engage in behaviors unbefitting their status, it not only diminishes their personal dignity but also undermines their standing in the community. The proverb serves as a reminder that age comes with responsibility and certain standards of behavior must be maintained to preserve one's honor and respect.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase emphasizes elders' responsibility to guide younger generations, while the second highlights the expectation that elders maintain dignified composure regardless of circumstances. Together, they frame the cultural context in which improper behavior by elders is seen as particularly shameful."
