  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u1eb8ni \u00e0 \u0144gb\u00e9 g\u1eb9\u0300g\u1eb9\u0300 ni y\u00f3 ba ara-a r\u1eb9\u0300 j\u1eb9\u0301.\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u00c0k\u00eds\u00e0-\u00e1 m\u1ecd \u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300n ara-a r\u1eb9\u0300, \u00f3 gb\u00e9 p\u00e1r\u00e1 j\u1eb9\u0301.\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The phrase \"\u00c0k\u00eds\u00e0-\u00e1 m\u1ecd \u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300n ara-a r\u1eb9\u0300, \u00f3 gb\u00e9 p\u00e1r\u00e1 j\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"The rag knows its limits/capacity, it carries dried stockfish.\" This implies someone knowing their limitations but still taking on more than they can handle.\n2. The imagery here is about someone of limited capacity (like a rag) attempting to carry something valuable (dried fish), which will likely result in the fish being ruined or spoiled.\n3. There's a connection to our main proverb through the concept of \"gb\u00e9\" (carrying) and \"j\u1eb9\u0301\" (ruining/spoiling).\n\nInterim Insight: Both phrases deal with the consequences of overestimating one's capacity or taking on roles beyond one's capabilities, leading to negative outcomes.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The person who is being lifted too high will ruin themselves.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: A k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9 oy\u00e8 \u1eb9nu \u1ecd\u0300n\u00e0 kal\u1eb9\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"A k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9 oy\u00e8 \u1eb9nu \u1ecd\u0300n\u00e0 kal\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"One does not enjoy chieftaincy at the entrance of the road.\" This suggests that positions of honor require proper positioning and context.\n2. This proverb warns against premature celebration or assuming authority in inappropriate contexts.\n3. It reinforces the idea that honor or elevation that comes too easily or in the wrong context is problematic.\n\nInterim Insight: This adds the cultural understanding that positions of honor or elevation come with proper context and responsibility. When one is elevated improperly or prematurely, it leads to one's downfall.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"The person who is lifted too high will end up ruining themselves.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb warns against seeking or accepting elevation beyond one's readiness or merit. In Yoruba culture, social hierarchy and proper timing for advancement are highly valued. The proverb teaches that when someone is promoted too quickly, given undue praise, or placed in a position they haven't earned or aren't prepared for, they will likely make mistakes that lead to their own downfall. It counsels humility and the importance of gradual, earned advancement rather than seeking shortcuts to positions of honor or responsibility.\n- References: The rag carrying dried fish beyond its capacity (Similar Phrase 1) and the improper enjoyment of chieftaincy status in an inappropriate location (Similar Phrase 2) both reinforce the cultural value of knowing one's place and the dangers of premature elevation.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eb8ni \u00e0 \u0144gb\u00e9 g\u1eb9\u0300g\u1eb9\u0300 ni y\u00f3 ba ara-a r\u1eb9\u0300 j\u1eb9\u0301\" translates to \"The person who is lifted too high will end up ruining themselves.\" It warns against accepting positions, praise, or status beyond what one has earned or is prepared for. In Yoruba wisdom, such unmerited elevation typically leads to one's own downfall, as the person will make mistakes due to their unreadiness. The proverb encourages appropriate timing, humility, and earned advancement rather than shortcuts to positions of honor."
