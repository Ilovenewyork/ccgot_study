  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\"\u1eb8 k\u00fa-ul\u00e9\" \u00f2 y\u1eb9 ar\u00e1 il\u00e9; \"\u1eb8 k\u00fa at\u00ecb\u00e0\" \u00f2 y\u1eb9ni t\u00ed \u0144t\u00e0j\u00f2 b\u1ecd\u0300; \u1eb9ni t\u00ed \u00f2 k\u00ed \u1eb9ni, \"K\u00fa at\u00ecb\u00e0\"-\u00e1 p\u00e0d\u00e1n\u00f9 \"\u1eb8 k\u00fa-ul\u00e9.\"\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u00c0\u00ec-k\u00fak\u00fa-joye, \u00f3 s\u00e0n ju, '\u1eb8nu\u00f9 mi \u00f2 k\u00e1 \u00ecl\u00fa' l\u1ecd\" translates roughly to \"Not having had the opportunity to rule at all is better than saying 'My voice couldn't control the town'\" \n2. This speaks to the importance of social responsibilities and roles within Yoruba culture - it's better not to have a position than to fail at it\n3. This relates to the main proverb which seems to discuss proper greetings based on social roles and positions\n\nInterim Insight: Both proverbs deal with social protocols and appropriate behavior based on one's position in society, emphasizing the importance of knowing and fulfilling one's social obligations.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Good day household\" is not appropriate for household members; \"Welcome visitor\" is not appropriate for someone who is coming as a visitor; one who doesn't greet appropriately with \"Welcome visitor\" will lose the \"Good day household\" greeting.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The phrase \"Ibi t\u00ed a ti m\u00fa \u1ecd\u0300l\u1eb9 \u00f2 k\u00fann\u00e1; ibi t\u00ed a ti m\u00fa al\u00e1gb\u00e1ra\u00e1 t\u00f3 oko-\u00f3 ro\" translates roughly to \"Where a lazy person is caught doesn't require gathering firewood; where a strong person is caught requires tying them to a farm\"\n2. This proverb speaks to how different situations require different approaches - context matters in Yoruba social interactions\n3. It reinforces the idea in the main proverb that different greetings are appropriate for different people based on their status or relationship\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase reinforces the importance of context-appropriate behavior in Yoruba culture - different situations call for different protocols, just as different people should receive different greetings.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Household members don't greet each other with 'Good day household'; visitors aren't greeted with 'Welcome visitor'; whoever doesn't properly greet others with 'Welcome visitor' will lose receiving the 'Good day household' greeting.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb teaches about the importance of proper greetings and social etiquette in Yoruba culture. It highlights that appropriate greetings should be given based on one's status and relationship. Household members don't need to greet each other as if they were visitors to their own home, and visitors shouldn't be greeted as if they lived there. The deeper meaning is that if you don't acknowledge others properly according to their status, you will lose the respect and acknowledgment due to your own status. In Yoruba culture, greetings are not merely pleasantries but important social indicators that reinforce community bonds and respect hierarchies.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase emphasizes the importance of fulfilling social roles properly, while the second phrase reinforces that different contexts require different approaches - both supporting the main proverb's teaching about proper social etiquette.\n\nFinal Answer: This Yoruba proverb teaches that proper greetings based on social context are essential. It literally means that household members don't greet each other as visitors and vice versa, but its deeper meaning is that failing to acknowledge others properly will result in losing the acknowledgment due to yourself. In Yoruba culture, appropriate greetings are crucial social protocols that maintain harmony and respect in communities."
