  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"Gbogbo \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n n\u00ed \u0144sunk\u00fan-un B\u00e1nj\u1ecd; \u1e63\u00f9gbo\u0301n\u0323 B\u00e1nj\u1ecd \u00f2 sunk\u00fan ara \u00e8\u0323\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **Gbogbo \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n** - This means \"Everybody\" or \"All people.\"\n2. **n\u00ed \u0144sunk\u00fan-un B\u00e1nj\u1ecd** - \"n\u00ed \u0144sunk\u00fan\" means \"are crying for\" or \"are lamenting for,\" and \"B\u00e1nj\u1ecd\" is a name. So, this part means \"are crying for B\u00e1nj\u1ecd.\"\n3. **\u1e63\u00f9gbo\u0301n\u0323** - This means \"but.\"\n4. **B\u00e1nj\u1ecd \u00f2 sunk\u00fan ara \u00e8\u0323** - \"B\u00e1nj\u1ecd\" is the name again, \"\u00f2\" is a negation meaning \"does not,\" \"sunk\u00fan\" means \"cry,\" and \"ara \u00e8\u0323\" means \"himself.\" So, this part means \"B\u00e1nj\u1ecd does not cry for himself.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb translates to: \"Everybody is crying for B\u00e1nj\u1ecd, but B\u00e1nj\u1ecd does not cry for himself.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that while others may be concerned or worried about someone's situation, the person themselves may not be as affected or concerned."
