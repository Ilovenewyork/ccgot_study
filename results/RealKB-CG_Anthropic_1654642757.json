This phrase speaks to proper social relations and hierarchy - a visitor shouldn't assume authority or cause embarrassment to their host.\n3. The structure follows a similar pattern to our proverb, using \"k\u00ec \u00ed\" (does not) and \"d\u00e1n\u00ed\" (put to shame).\n4. Both proverbs appear to be about maintaining proper order in relationships.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb likely deals with proper roles and boundaries, where one entity should not overstep its position to embarrass or disadvantage another.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"The hawk does not swoop down so that the chicken can catch insects to shame (someone).\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00f2 b\u00e1 \u1e63e ohun \u1eb9\u0300r\u00f9, \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed s\u00e1.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00f2 b\u00e1 \u1e63e ohun \u1eb9\u0300r\u00f9, \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed s\u00e1\" translates to \"If an elder doesn't do something frightening, a child won't run away.\"\n2. This proverb speaks to cause and effect, particularly related to authority figures and their influence on others' behavior.\n3. It suggests that people in power create the conditions for others' reactions.\n4. This helps us understand our main proverb: the hawk (powerful predator) creates conditions that affect the chicken's behavior.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb appears to be about power dynamics, where the powerful (hawk) should not create situations that lead to embarrassment by enabling lesser beings (chickens) to act beyond their station.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A hawk does not swoop down merely for a chicken to catch insects and put someone to shame.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb speaks to proper social order and hierarchy. The hawk is a powerful predator while the chicken is prey. The natural order is for hawks to hunt chickens, not to help them catch insects. The proverb teaches that those in positions of power should not diminish themselves to elevate those beneath them in ways that disrupt social harmony. It warns against inverting natural hierarchies or enabling those of lower status to embarrass or challenge those above them. The wisdom reminds us that each person has their proper role in society, and attempting to reverse these roles leads to disorder and shame.\n\n- References: The interpretation draws from both \"\u00c0lej\u00f2 k\u00ec \u00ed l\u1ecd k\u00f3 m\u00fa on\u00edl\u00e9 d\u00e1n\u00ed\" (a visitor shouldn't shame their host) and \"B\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00f2 b\u00e1 \u1e63e ohun \u1eb9\u0300r\u00f9, \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed s\u00e1\" (elders' actions determine children's reactions), highlighting Yoruba cultural values around social order, respect for hierarchy, and proper conduct between those of different statuses."
