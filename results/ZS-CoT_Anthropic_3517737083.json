  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the components:\n- \"K\u00e1 w\u00ed og\u00fan, k\u00e1 w\u00ed \u1ecdgb\u1ecd\u0300n\" - This suggests speaking repeatedly, possibly referencing speaking twenty or thirty times\n- \"Ng \u00f2 f\u1eb9\u0301, ng \u00f2 gb\u00e0\" - This means \"I don't want, I don't accept\"\n- \"la\u1e63iw\u00e8r\u00e9 fi \u0144p\u1eb9\u0300kun \u1ecd\u0300r\u00e0n\" - This refers to how a foolish person ends or concludes a matter\n\nPutting it together in proper English:\n\n\"You may speak twenty times, you may speak thirty times, but 'I don't want it, I won't accept it' is how a fool ends a discussion.\"\n\nThe meaning: This proverb speaks to stubbornness and closed-mindedness. It suggests that no matter how much wisdom or advice is offered, a foolish person simply refuses to listen or consider other perspectives, abruptly ending discussions with blanket refusals rather than reasoned engagement."
