It conveys that even though the person has grown old physically (\"mo d\u00e0gb\u00e0\" - I have grown old) and tall/mature (\"mo d\u00e0g\u00f3\" - I have grown tall/big), they still retain the enthusiasm, curiosity, and playfulness characteristic of youth (\"ar\u00e9 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 \u00f2 t\u00e1n l\u00f3j\u00fa\u00f9 mi\" - the play/energy of a child has not disappeared from my eyes).\n\nThe proverb celebrates the value of maintaining a youthful perspective regardless of age. It suggests that wisdom and maturity need not come at the expense of joy, wonder, and playfulness. It's similar to the English expression \"young at heart\" but more poetic in its imagery of youth remaining visible in one's eyes despite the body's aging."
