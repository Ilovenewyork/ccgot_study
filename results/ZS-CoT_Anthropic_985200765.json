  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the components:\n- \"Mo m\u1ecd\u0300-\u1ecd\u0301 t\u00e1n\" = \"I know it completely\" or \"I have figured it out\"\n- \"lOr\u00f2-\u00f3 fi\" = \"is how/why Oro\" (Oro being a Yoruba deity or spiritual entity)\n- \"\u0144gb\u00e9 \u1ecdk\u00f9nrin\" = \"carries away men\" or \"takes men\"\n\nPutting it together, the literal translation would be:\n\"'I know it completely' is how/why Oro carries away men.\"\n\nThe meaning behind this proverb:\nThis proverb is warning against overconfidence or the danger of thinking you know everything. It suggests that when someone becomes too confident in their knowledge (\"I know it completely\"), that's when they become vulnerable to being \"carried away\" by Oro (representing danger or death).\n\nThe English equivalent would be:\n\"'I have it all figured out' is how Oro carries away men.\"\n\nThe general message is that excessive confidence or presumption of complete knowledge often leads to downfall."
