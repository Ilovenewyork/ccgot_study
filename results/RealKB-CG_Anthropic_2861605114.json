The similar phrase \"B\u00ed eegb\u1ecd\u0301n b\u00e1 so m\u1ecd\u0301 aj\u00e1 l\u1eb9\u0301nu, ak\u00e1t\u00e1 l\u00e0 \u0144n\u00ed k\u00f3 j\u00e1 a?\" translates to \"If a coconut is tied to a dog's mouth, do we ask a wildcat to cut it loose?\"\n2. This proverb suggests that a problem should be solved by the most appropriate person, not just anyone.\n3. Both proverbs involve animals (dog/wildcat in the similar phrase; leopard/tiger/civet cat in the main proverb).\n4. Both proverbs seem to address matters of appropriate roles, relationships, and responsibilities.\n\nInterim Insight: The main proverb likely deals with the importance of natural bonds, loyalty, and appropriate relationships, using wild animals as metaphors for different types of influences or authority figures.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A tribe/clan gave birth to me, a tiger/leopard raised me to adulthood, a civet cat adopted me; if there's no animal in the soup, I won't eat.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"B\u00ed \u00f2k\u00fa f\u1eb9\u0300, b\u00ed k\u00f2 f\u1eb9\u0300, k\u00e1 bi \u1ecdm\u1ecd ol\u00f3k\u00f9\u00fa l\u00e9\u00e8r\u00e8\" translates to \"Whether the dead likes it or not, let's ask the child of the deceased.\"\n2. This proverb emphasizes the importance of consulting those with direct connection or inheritance to a matter.\n3. It suggests that proper protocol requires respecting established relationships and lineages.\n4. The main proverb similarly addresses the concept of loyalty to one's upbringing and formative influences.\n\nInterim Insight: The main proverb appears to be about identity shaped by multiple influences, with the final clause suggesting unwavering loyalty to one's background - refusing to \"eat soup without meat\" metaphorically meaning refusing to abandon one's values or origins.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"My clan gave birth to me, a leopard raised me to adulthood, a civet cat adopted me; if there is no meat in the soup, I won't eat.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb speaks to the multiple influences that shape a person's identity and values. The imagery of powerful wild animals (leopard, civet cat) raising and adopting someone born into a human clan suggests diverse and formidable influences on one's upbringing. The final clause about refusing to eat soup without meat symbolizes unwavering loyalty to one's upbringing and formative influences - the person will not compromise on the core values instilled by their various \"guardians.\" In Yoruba culture, this reflects the importance of honoring one's lineage and the multiple communities that contribute to personal development, while maintaining integrity to the values they instill.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase reminds us that proper roles and relationships matter in solving problems. The second similar phrase reinforces the importance of respecting established connections and consulting those with direct lineage to a matter.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u1eb8\u0300y\u00e1 l\u00f3 b\u00ed mi, \u1eb9k\u00f9n l\u00f3 w\u00f2 m\u00ed d\u00e0gb\u00e0, ol\u00f3g\u00ecnn\u00ed gb\u00e0 m\u00ed t\u1ecd\u0301; b\u00ed k\u00f2 s\u1eb9\u0301ran l\u1ecd\u0301b\u1eb9\u0300 nk\u00f2 j\u1eb9\" means \"My clan gave birth to me, a leopard raised me to adulthood, a civet cat adopted me; if there is no meat in the soup, I won't eat.\" It speaks to how a person's identity is shaped by diverse influences (family, community, mentors) while emphasizing unwavering loyalty to the core values these influences instill. The person remains committed to their principles and refuses to compromise on what they've been taught to value, just as they would refuse soup without meat. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the importance of honoring one's origins"
