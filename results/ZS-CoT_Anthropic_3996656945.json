  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down component by component:\n\n\"\u00c0f\u00f2pin\u00e1\" - This refers to a moth or an insect that flies around fire/light\n\"t\u00f3 n\u00ed\" - that says/claims\n\"\u00f2un \u00f3 pa f\u00ect\u00edl\u00e0\" - it will put out/extinguish the lamp/light\n\"ara \u1eb9\u0300 ni y\u00f3 pa\" - it will kill/destroy itself\n\nPutting it all together, the literal translation is:\n\"The moth that says it will extinguish the lamp will only destroy itself.\"\n\nThe English equivalent would be:\n\"The moth that claims it will put out the lamp will only end up killing itself.\"\n\nThis proverb carries the meaning that when someone tries to destroy something much more powerful than themselves, they are likely to be the one who gets destroyed in the process. It warns against overestimating one's abilities or challenging forces beyond one's capacity."
