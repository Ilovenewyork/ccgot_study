  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"A\u00e1y\u00e1n ati e\u00e8r\u00e0\u00e1 \u1e63\u00edgun, wo\u0301\u0323n n\u00ed \u00e0wo\u0301\u0323n \u0144l\u1ecd m\u00fa ad\u00ec\u1eb9 \u00e0l\u1ecd la r\u00ed, a \u00f2 r\u00e1bo\u0300\u0323\" can be translated to English as: \"The termites and ants are digging, they say they are going to catch a runaway chicken, we shall see.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb uses the imagery of termites and ants, which are small and seemingly insignificant creatures, attempting to catch a runaway chicken, which is a task that seems beyond their capability. The phrase \"we shall see\" implies skepticism about their ability to achieve this goal. The proverb is often used to express doubt about someone's ability to accomplish a task that seems too ambitious or beyond their means. It serves as a reminder to be realistic about one's capabilities and to not overestimate one's power or influence."
