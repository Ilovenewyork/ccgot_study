  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n**Literal Translation:**\n\"Since the day I was born, I have never seen such a thing\": the owner/master knows his own limits/worth.\n\n**Meaning:**\nThis proverb is about self-awareness and knowing one's position or capabilities. It conveys that when someone exclaims \"I've never seen such a thing before!\" about someone else's behavior, it often indicates that the person in question is acting beyond their appropriate social standing or abilities.\n\nThe proverb suggests that everyone should understand their place in society, their capabilities, and their limitations. It cautions against overreaching or pretending to be what you are not. The true owner or master of something (or oneself) properly understands their own worth and limitations.\n\nThis is similar to the English sayings \"Know your place\" or \"Know your limits,\" but with the Yoruba cultural context of social hierarchy and proper behavior according to one's station in life."
