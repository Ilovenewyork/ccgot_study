This imagery implies that when something is held back or controlled, it is not in its natural state, and there is an expectation or potential for it to break free or act differently if not restrained.  \nInterim Insight: The proverb may involve themes of control, restraint, or the potential for change when conditions are altered.\n\n**Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation**  \n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.  \nTranslation: \"As you know it, the bean seller of Shapon.\"\n\n**Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection**  \nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00c0w\u00f2r\u00f2 t\u00ed a \u00f2 b\u00e1 l\u00f9 k\u00ec \u00ed luni.\n\n**Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2**  \n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.  \nChain-of-Thought:  \n1.

This implies that without interaction or a trigger, the true essence or potential of something remains hidden or dormant.  \nInterim Insight: The proverb may be highlighting the idea that understanding or revealing the true nature of something requires interaction or experience.\n\n**Final Synthesis:**  \n- Final Translation: \"As you know it, the bean seller of Shapon.\"  \n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: The proverb \"\u1e62e b\u00f3o ti m\u1ecd, \u1eb9l\u00e9\u0323w\u00e0a \u1e62\u00e0po\u0301\u0323n\" suggests that familiarity or prior knowledge of a situation or person (like the bean seller of Shapon) influences one's understanding or expectations.
