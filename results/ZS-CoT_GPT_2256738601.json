  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"B\u00ed ay\u00e1 b\u00e1 moj\u00fa \u1ecdk\u1ecd, al\u00e1r\u00ecnn\u00e0 a y\u1eb9s\u00e8\u0323\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **B\u00ed** - This means \"if\" or \"when.\"\n2. **ay\u00e1** - This refers to \"wife.\"\n3. **b\u00e1 moj\u00fa** - This phrase means \"faces\" or \"confronts.\"\n4. **\u1ecdk\u1ecd** - This means \"husband.\"\n5. **al\u00e1r\u00ecnn\u00e0** - This refers to a \"mediator\" or \"intermediary.\"\n6. **a y\u1eb9s\u00e8\u0323** - This means \"will step aside\" or \"will withdraw.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated to English as: \"When the wife faces the husband, the mediator will step aside.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that when two people directly address their issues or confront each other, the need for a mediator or intermediary becomes unnecessary."
