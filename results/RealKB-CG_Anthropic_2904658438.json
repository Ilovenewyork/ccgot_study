  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"Gbogbo \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n n\u00ed \u0144sunk\u00fan-un B\u00e1nj\u1ecd; \u1e63\u00f9gb\u1ecd\u0301n B\u00e1nj\u1ecd \u00f2 sunk\u00fan ara \u1eb9\u0300.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u00c0 \u0144sunk\u00fan Aw\u00fagb\u00f3, Aw\u00fagb\u00f3 \u00f2 sunk\u00fan ara-a \u1eb9\u0300\" has the same structure as our target proverb, replacing \"B\u00e1nj\u1ecd\" with \"Aw\u00fagb\u00f3\".\n2. Both proverbs feature a pattern where everyone is mourning/crying for someone (B\u00e1nj\u1ecd or Aw\u00fagb\u00f3), but that person isn't crying for themselves.\n3. This suggests a situation where people show concern for someone who doesn't show the same concern for their own situation.\n4. Names like B\u00e1nj\u1ecd and Aw\u00fagb\u00f3 are likely representing any individual in this context, not specific people.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb appears to highlight a disconnect between others' perception of someone's troubles and that person's own perception of their situation.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Everyone is crying for Banjo; but Banjo is not crying for himself.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"M\u00e9l\u00f2\u00f3 l\u00c8j\u00ecgb\u00f2 t\u00ed \u1ecd\u0300kan \u1eb9\u0300 \u0144j\u1eb9\u0301 Ay\u00e9-gbogbo?\" translates roughly to \"How many people are in Ejigbo that one of them is called 'Owner-of-the-whole-world'?\"\n2. This phrase questions someone's self-importance or someone who acts like they own everything or know everything.\n3. When connected to our proverb, it suggests that while others may be concerned about someone's welfare (crying for Banjo), that person may be unconcerned or have a different perspective about their own situation.\n4. It adds the cultural nuance that sometimes what outsiders perceive as problems might not be seen as such by the person experiencing them.\n\nInterim Insight: The second phrase reinforces the idea that external perceptions often differ from internal ones, and suggests a critique of those who concern themselves with others' affairs when their perspective may be limited.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Everyone cries for Banjo, but Banjo does not cry for himself.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the discrepancy between how others perceive someone's situation versus how that person perceives it themselves. It teaches that outsiders often show concern or pity for someone who doesn't see their own situation as pitiable. The proverb cautions against assuming others need our sympathy when they may have a different understanding of their circumstances. In Yoruba culture, this reflects the value placed on personal perspective and the recognition that external judgment may be misplaced. It reminds us that before feeling sorry for others, we should consider whether they actually see themselves as unfortunate.\n\n- References: The proverb's meaning is reinforced by Similar Phrase 1 \"\u00c0 \u0144sunk\u00fan Aw\u00fagb\u00f3, Aw\u00fagb\u00f3 \u00f2 sunk\u00fan ara-a \u1eb9\u0300\" which follows the same pattern of outsiders crying for someone who doesn't cry for themselves, and Similar Phrase 2 \"M\u00e9l\u00f2\u00f3 l\u00c8j\u00ecgb\u00f2 t\u00ed \u1ecd\u0300kan \u1eb9\u0300 \u0144j\u1eb9\u0301 Ay\u00e9-gbogbo?\" which questions the validity of outsider perspectives.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"Gbogbo \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n n\u00ed \u0144sunk\u00fan-un B\u00e1nj\u1ecd; \u1e63\u00f9gb\u1ecd\u0301n B\u00e1nj\u1ecd \u00f2 sunk\u00fan ara \u1eb9\u0300\" translates to \"Everyone cries for Banjo, but Banjo does not cry for himself.\" It teaches that others often feel sorry for someone who doesn't feel sorry for themselves, highlighting the gap between external perceptions and personal experience. This proverb reminds us not to impose our judgments on others' situations, as they may have a completely different understanding of their own circumstances. In Yoruba wisdom, it encourages respect for individual perspectives"
