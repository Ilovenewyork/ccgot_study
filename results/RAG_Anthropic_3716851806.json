In Yoruba culture:\n- \"\u1e62\u00e0k\u00ec\" refers to a burial shroud or cloth\n- \"\u1ecc\u0300r\u00e1\" refers to velvet or fine cloth\n- \"Egungun\" refers to a masquerade or ancestral spirit costume\n- \"\u1eb8ran\" means flesh/human\n\nThe proverb points out how things may appear to be something they are not. The burial shroud might look impressive like velvet, but it's still just a burial cloth. Similarly, the masquerade costume may appear human-like, but there's just a person underneath the costume.\n\nThis wisdom cautions against being deceived by outward appearances and reminds us that things are not always what they seem. It teaches discernment between genuine substance and mere imitation."
