  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00d2n\u00ed, \u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn, o\u0300\u0323la, \u1eb9t\u00fa j\u00ecnf\u00ecn; \u1eb9tu n\u00eckan l\u1eb9ran t\u00f3 w\u00e0 n\u00edgb\u00f3?\" translates to \"Today, the duiker is scarce, tomorrow, the duiker is scarce; is the duiker the only animal in the forest?\"\n\nThis proverb is used to highlight the idea of over-reliance on a single source or option. It questions the wisdom of focusing on just one thing when there are many other possibilities available. The duiker, a type of small antelope, is used metaphorically to represent a resource or opportunity that is being overly depended upon. The proverb suggests that one should diversify their options and not put all their eggs in one basket, as there are many other opportunities (or \"animals in the forest\") to explore."
