It uses the imagery of a dog (aj\u00e1) attempting to hunt a much larger and more dangerous predator (\u1eb9k\u00f9n - tiger/leopard) in the deep forest (s\u00e1ginj\u00f9).\n\nThe proverb teaches that one should not take on challenges that are clearly beyond their capacity or strength. Just as it would be foolish and dangerous for a dog to hunt a tiger, people should recognize their limitations and not engage in endeavors that would likely lead to their downfall.\n\nThis is similar to English sayings like \"Don't bite off more than you can chew\" or \"Know your limits.\" It's a warning against overestimating one's abilities and a reminder to approach challenges with realistic expectations."
