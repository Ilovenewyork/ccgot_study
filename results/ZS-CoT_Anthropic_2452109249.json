  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down step by step:\n\n\"\u1eb8ran k\u00ed la \u00f2 j\u1eb9 r\u00ed?\" - This first part literally asks \"What meat have we not eaten before?\" which implies \"We've experienced many things in life.\"\n\n\"\u1ecc\u0300p\u1ecd\u0300l\u1ecd\u0301 b\u00e1ni l\u00e1b\u00e0t\u00e0 \u00f3 ba b\u00far\u00fab\u00far\u00fa.\" - This part refers to encountering the toad (\u1ecd\u0300p\u1ecd\u0300l\u1ecd\u0301) wearing shoes (l\u00e1b\u00e0t\u00e0), and the shoes being oversized or ill-fitting (b\u00far\u00fab\u00far\u00fa).\n\nPutting these components together, the proverb is expressing surprise or disbelief at seeing something unusual or inappropriate.\n\nEnglish translation: \"What kind of meat haven't we eaten before? (Now) we see a toad wearing oversized shoes.\"\n\nThe meaning: Just when you think you've seen everything in life, something even more surprising comes along. This proverb is used to express astonishment at unusual or inappropriate situations, similar to the English expression \"Now I've seen everything!\""
