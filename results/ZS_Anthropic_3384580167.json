  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"One masquerade surpasses another masquerade; one deity surpasses another deity; [But] P\u00e0\u00e0k\u00e1 (leopard) makes the Sango worshipper run into the bush.\"\n\nThe proverb essentially means that while there are hierarchies and different levels of power among similar entities (like masquerades or deities), there are some forces that can humble even those who command respect or have spiritual power. It speaks to the idea that no matter how powerful someone might be in their domain, there is always something more powerful that can make them flee."
