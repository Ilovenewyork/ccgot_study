It suggests that even after one has had enough to eat, it is not proper to continue indulging excessively. The imagery of using all ten fingers to eat implies a lack of restraint and decorum. The proverb teaches that it is important to know when to stop and to maintain dignity and self-discipline, even in situations of abundance. It serves as a reminder to practice moderation in all aspects of life."
