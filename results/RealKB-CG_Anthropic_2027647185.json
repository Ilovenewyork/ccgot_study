  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed gb\u1ecd\u0301n ju \u1eb9ni t\u00ed a m\u00e1a d\u00cdf\u00e1 f\u00fan.\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u1eb8ni t\u00ed a b\u00e1 \u0144d\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd f\u00fan k\u00ec \u00ed ka \u00e8\u00e8w\u1ecd\u0300.\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"\u1eb8ni t\u00ed a b\u00e1 \u0144d\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd f\u00fan k\u00ec \u00ed ka \u00e8\u00e8w\u1ecd\u0300\" translates to \"The person for whom a garment is being sewn should not dictate the taboos/restrictions.\" This suggests a power dynamic where the recipient of a service shouldn't be dictating terms to the provider.\n2. This relates to traditional Yoruba contexts where specialists (like tailors) have expertise that should be respected. The recipient shouldn't try to overstep their position by acting more knowledgeable than the specialist.\n\nInterim Insight: This similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with respecting the expertise of specialists or professionals and not claiming to know more than them, particularly in ritual or professional contexts.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"One should not be wiser than the person who will cast If\u00e1 divination for them.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u1eb8ni t\u00ed a l\u00e8 gb\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed daw\u1ecd\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1eb8ni t\u00ed a l\u00e8 gb\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed daw\u1ecd\u0301\" translates to \"The person who is being carried shouldn't stretch out their hands.\" This refers to someone who is being helped (carried) shouldn't try to do things themselves or interfere with the helper's method.\n2. This reinforces the message about hierarchies of expertise and the appropriate behavior when receiving help or service from someone with specialized knowledge.\n\nInterim Insight: Both similar phrases emphasize the importance of respecting expertise and not interfering when someone is providing you with a specialized service, whether it's divination, tailoring, or physical assistance.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"One should not claim to be wiser than the person performing If\u00e1 divination for them.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb addresses the relationship between a diviner (babalawo) and their client. In Yoruba culture, If\u00e1 divination is a complex spiritual system requiring years of training and deep knowledge. The proverb cautions against arrogance when consulting experts, particularly spiritual ones. It reminds us to respect specialized knowledge and not presume to know more than those whose expertise we seek. This extends beyond divination to any professional-client relationship where specialized knowledge is involved. The wisdom emphasizes humility when seeking guidance and acknowledging the boundaries between the roles of service provider and recipient.\n\n- References: The proverb's meaning is illuminated by Similar Phrase 1 (about not dictating terms to a tailor) and Similar Phrase 2 (about not interfering when being carried), both reinforcing the cultural value of respecting expertise and maintaining appropriate roles in service relationships.\n\nFinal Answer: The Yoruba proverb \"A k\u00ec \u00ed gb\u1ecd\u0301n ju \u1eb9ni t\u00ed a m\u00e1a d\u00cdf\u00e1 f\u00fan\" means \"One should not claim to be wiser than the person performing If\u00e1 divination for them.\" It teaches the importance of respecting experts in their domain and maintaining humility when seeking specialized services. In Yoruba culture, this especially applies to spiritual consultations with If\u00e1 diviners (babalawos), but extends to all professional relationships where specialized knowledge is involved. The proverb warns against the arrogance of thinking you know more than the expert whose help you're seeking."
