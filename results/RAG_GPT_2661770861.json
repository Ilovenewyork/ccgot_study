  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"On\u00edg\u00e8\u0323g\u00e9\u0323 f\u00ecl\u00e8\u0323k\u00e8\u0323 do\u0301\u0323po\u0300\u0323; on\u00edl\u00e8\u0323k\u00e8\u0323 \u00ecb\u00e1 gbowo, ko ro\u0301\u0323r\u00f9n f\u00ecl\u00e8\u0323k\u00e8\u0323 so\" can be translated to English as: \"The bead seller has left the beads on the ground; if the owner of the beads were to demand payment, it would not be easy to string the beads together.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb highlights the idea of taking responsibility and the consequences of neglecting one's duties or possessions. The bead seller, who should be responsible for the beads, has carelessly left them on the ground. If the rightful owner of the beads were to demand accountability or payment, it would be a challenging task to gather and string the beads back together. The proverb serves as a cautionary reminder to be diligent and responsible in one's actions, as neglect can lead to difficult situations and the need to rectify mistakes."
