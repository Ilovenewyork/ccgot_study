  "gold": "The person with goitre offers a ridiculously low price for beads; were the beads seller to accept her offer she would have no neck to string the beads around.",
  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"The owner of beads carefully threads them together; if the owner of the thread had money, it wouldn't be difficult to string beads.\"\n\nThis proverb speaks to the relationship between resources and capability. It suggests that while someone with beads can arrange them, the person who owns the thread (a less expensive item) could easily string beads if they had the financial means to purchase them. It highlights how economic circumstances can limit what people are able to accomplish, even when they have the skills or tools for part of a task."
