  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"A proud person enters the market walking majestically, a filthy person enters the market walking slowly; it is the filthy person who carries the proud person's load home.\"\n\nThe proverb teaches about humility and the deceptiveness of appearances. It suggests that someone who appears impressive and walks with pride may actually depend on the humble or seemingly less important person. It's a lesson that those who display themselves grandly may ultimately rely on those who are modest or underestimated."
