  "gen": "This Yoruba proverb translates to English as:\n\n\"The cockroach and the ant set out on a journey, saying they were going to catch a hen that went out but never returned.\"\n\nThe proverb uses irony to point out the folly of small creatures (cockroach and ant) attempting something beyond their capabilities (capturing a chicken). It's often used to caution against overambition or attempting tasks that are clearly beyond one's abilities or resources."
