  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"K\u00e1 w\u00ed og\u00fan, k\u00e1 w\u00ed \u1ecdgbo\u0300\u0323n, \u201cNg \u00f2 f\u00e9\u0323, ng \u00f2 gb\u00e0\u201d la\u1e63iw\u00e8r\u00e9 fi \u0144p\u00e8\u0323kun o\u0300\u0323r\u00e0n\" can be translated to English as: \"After discussing strategies and wisdom, 'I don't want, I won't accept' is how a mad person ends a matter.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb highlights the futility of trying to reason with someone who is irrational or unwilling to listen. It suggests that no matter how much wisdom or strategy is applied to a situation, if a person is not open to accepting advice or solutions, the effort is wasted. The use of \"la\u1e63iw\u00e8r\u00e9\" (a mad person) emphasizes the stubbornness or irrationality of such an individual, who ultimately dismisses all logical discourse with a simple refusal. The proverb serves as a reminder of the limitations of reasoning with someone who is not receptive to it."
