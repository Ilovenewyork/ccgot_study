  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation\n\n**Translation:** \n\"The person going to the pig market asks, 'Is it five hundred pigs or six hundred pigs?'; which one did you take from there?\"\n\n**Explanation:**\nThis Yoruba proverb is making fun of someone who boasts or asks questions about things they haven't yet accomplished. The person is talking about how many pigs they'll buy (asking whether there are 500 or 600 pigs available), yet they haven't even purchased a single one.\n\nThe proverb mocks those who count their chickens before they hatch or who pretend to be knowledgeable about matters they have no real experience with. The final question \"which one did you take from there?\" highlights the irony - the person hasn't taken any pigs at all, making their detailed questions about quantities meaningless.\n\nIt serves as a warning against premature boasting or speculation before actually achieving something concrete."
