The phrase uses parallel structure comparing humans (men) to nature (trees) to emphasize natural law and order.\n4. It suggests that certain actions are inappropriate or unnatural for specific beings based on their inherent nature.\n\nInterim Insight: The original proverb likely deals with natural limitations and appropriate roles - suggesting that certain beings shouldn't attempt tasks beyond their capability or nature, similar to how men shouldn't wail or male trees shouldn't produce sap in Yoruba cultural understanding.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.\n\nTranslation: \"A dog does not go to the deep forest to hunt a tiger/leopard.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: B\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00f2 b\u00e1 \u1e63e ohun \u1eb9\u0300r\u00f9, \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed s\u00e1.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"B\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00e0 k\u00f2 b\u00e1 \u1e63e ohun \u1eb9\u0300r\u00f9, \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9 k\u00ec \u00ed s\u00e1\" translates to \"If an elder does not do something frightening, a child will not run away\" - suggesting that leadership example determines followers' actions.\n2.
