This similar phrase contains key elements from the original proverb, specifically mentioning \"\u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0\" (elder), \"\u00e0\u1e63ej\u00f9\" (excess), and \"\u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0301\" (shame/disgrace).\n2. It suggests that an elder who engages in excessive behavior will end up in shame or disgrace.\n3. The phrase implies a cultural expectation that elders should model restraint and appropriate behavior.\n4. The use of \"w\u1eb9\u0300w\u00f9\" suggests wearing or putting on excess like a garment, showing how one embraces inappropriate behavior.\n\nInterim Insight: This appears to be a cautionary proverb about the consequences of excessive or inappropriate behavior, especially for those who should know better (elders).\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Excess is the father of shame; shame is the end result of excess; an elder who wears the garment of excess will end up in shame.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: Al\u00e1\u1e63ej\u00f9, p\u1eb9\u0300r\u1eb9\u0300 n\u00ed \u0144t\u1eb9\u0301; \u00e0\u1e63\u00e9j\u00f9, baba \u00e0\u1e63et\u1eb9\u0301.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second phrase reinforces the relationship between excess (\u00e0\u1e63ej\u00f9) and shame (\u00e0\u1e63et\u1eb9\u0301), explicitly stating that excess is the \"father\" of shame.\n2. \"Al\u00e1\u1e63ej\u00f9, p\u1eb9\u0300r\u1eb9\u0300 n\u00ed \u0144t\u1eb9\u0301\" suggests that one who engages in excess will quickly or eventually be disgraced.\n3. The structure shows a cause-and-effect relationship, emphasizing the inevitable consequences of immoderate behavior.\n4. This phrase lacks the specific reference to elders, suggesting the principle applies universally, though the original proverb emphasizes its application to elders.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb teaches moderation as a cultural value in Yoruba society, with particular emphasis on how shameful it is when respected elders fail to demonstrate this virtue.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Excess is the father of shame; shame follows excess; an elder who indulges in excess will end in disgrace.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb emphasizes the cultural value of moderation (\u00ecw\u1ecd\u0300nt\u00fanw\u1ecd\u0300ns\u00ec) in Yoruba society. It teaches that excessive behavior inevitably leads to shame or disgrace, and this is particularly unbecoming for elders who should exemplify wisdom and self-restraint. In Yoruba culture, elders are expected to model appropriate behavior for younger generations. The proverb uses the metaphor of \"wearing excess like a garment\" to illustrate how people consciously choose immoderate behavior. It serves as both a warning about the consequences of excess and a reminder of the social expectations placed on those of advanced age and presumed wisdom.\n\n- References: Both Similar Phrase 1 \"\u00c0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 t\u00f3 w\u1eb9\u0300w\u00f9 \u00e0\u1e63ej\u00f9, \u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0301 ni y\u00f3 fi r\u00ed\" and Similar Phrase 2 \"Al\u00e1\u1e63ej\u00f9, p\u1eb9\u0300r\u1eb9\u0300 n\u00ed \u0144t\u1eb9\u0301; \u00e0\u1e63\u00e9j\u00f9, baba \u00e0\u1e63et\u1eb9\u0301\" reinforce the central theme that excess leads to shame, with particular emphasis on the expectations of elders in Yoruba society.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00c0\u1e63ej\u00f9 baba \u00e0\u1e63et\u1eb9\u0301; \u1eb9\u0300t\u1eb9\u0301 n\u00ed \u0144gb\u1eb9\u0300h\u00ecn \u00e0\u1e63ej\u00f9; \u00e0gb\u00e0lagb\u00e0 t\u00f3 w\u1eb9\u0300w\u00f9 \u00e0\u1e63ej"
