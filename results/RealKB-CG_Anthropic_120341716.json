  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00ccy\u00e0w\u00f3 t\u00f3 na \u1ecdm\u1ecd \u1ecdb\u00e0kan, \u1ecd\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300 l\u00f3 f\u1eb9\u0301 gb\u1ecd\u0301.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"\u1e62\u00e1go \u1e3fb\u00fag\u00f2, \u00f3 l\u00f3 \u1e63\u1eb9nu gb\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd\u0301r\u1ecd\u0301\" appears to be about someone who makes a gesture that invites conversation or response.\n2. The structure seems similar to our target proverb - describing an action followed by the true intention behind it.\n3. In Yoruba culture, actions often serve as indirect communication methods when direct speech might be inappropriate.\n4. Both phrases seem to describe situations where an action is performed with the ulterior motive of initiating dialogue.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase suggests our proverb likely deals with indirect communication strategies, where an action is taken not for its own sake but to provoke a response or conversation.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"A wife who beats her stepchild wants to hear words (or wants to provoke a conversation).\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"On\u00ed\u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 t\u00f3 j\u00f3 t\u00ed k\u00f2 gb\u1ecdn y\u1eb9\u0300r\u00ec: \u00e0b\u00f9k\u00f9-u \u1e62\u00e0ng\u00f3 k\u1ecd\u0301; \u00e0b\u00f9k\u00f9 ara \u1eb9\u0300 ni\" roughly translates to \"A Sango worshipper who dances but doesn't tremble: it's not Sango who is disgraced, but the person themselves.\"\n2. This phrase emphasizes personal responsibility and how one's improper actions reflect poorly on oneself, not on what they represent.\n3. It highlights the Yoruba cultural value of appropriate behavior in social contexts and hierarchy.\n4. Applied to our proverb, it suggests the wife's behavior toward her stepchild reflects on her character, not necessarily on the child.\n\nInterim Insight: The similar phrase adds a dimension of personal accountability and social judgment to our understanding of the proverb - improper actions reveal one's true character and motives.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"A wife who beats her stepchild is simply looking for conversation (or trouble).\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb reveals the complex family dynamics in polygamous households. It suggests that when a wife mistreats her stepchild (her co-wife's child), her real intention is not discipline but to provoke a reaction or conflict with the child's mother or other family members. The proverb speaks to the indirect communication patterns in Yoruba culture, where actions often carry hidden agendas. It warns against using innocent parties (children) as pawns in adult conflicts and highlights how such behavior exposes one's true character. In traditional Yoruba society, harmony in extended families is highly valued, and this proverb serves as both a caution against and an interpretation of disruptive behavior in blended families.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase illustrates how actions can be invitations for dialogue in Yoruba communication patterns. The second phrase reinforces how inappropriate behavior reflects poorly on the individual rather than their position or what they represent, emphasizing personal accountability in Yoruba social ethics."
