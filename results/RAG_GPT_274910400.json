  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u1e62e b\u00f3o ti m\u1ecd, \u1eb9l\u00e9\u0323w\u00e0a \u1e62\u00e0po\u0301\u0323n\" can be translated to English as \"Is it as you know it, the bean seller of Sapon?\" \n\nExplanation: This proverb is often used to question someone's certainty or confidence about a situation. It implies that things may not always be as they seem or as one assumes. The mention of \"\u1eb9l\u00e9\u0323w\u00e0a \u1e62\u00e0po\u0301\u0323n\" (the bean seller of Sapon) is a metaphorical reference, suggesting that just as one might think they know the bean seller well, there might be aspects or details that are not immediately apparent. It serves as a reminder to be cautious and not overly confident in one's assumptions or knowledge."
