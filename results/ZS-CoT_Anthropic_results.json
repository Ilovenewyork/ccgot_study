The full translation:\n   \"The eye has never seen honor/wealth, yet it gives birth to a child and names it 'Honor is sweet.'\"\n\n4. The deeper meaning:\n   This proverb speaks to irony or presumption - someone who has no experience with wealth or honor yet names their child as if they do. It comments on people who claim or aspire to things they haven't actually experienced."

    "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\n1) Breaking down the components:\n   - \"O\u00f2r\u00f9n\" = sun\n   - \"k\u00f3 t\u00ec\u1eb9 w\u1ecd\u0300\" = should set/go down\n   - \"k\u00e1 m\u00e1 b\u00e0\u00e1 \u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301j\u1ecd\u0301 w\u00ed\" = so that we don't have to blame/quarrel with the owner/master of the day\n\n2) Putting it together literally:\n   \"The sun should set so that we don't have to blame the owner of the day.\"\n\n3) Understanding the meaning:\n   This proverb suggests that things should follow their natural course or timing. Just as the sun naturally sets at the end of the day, we should allow events to conclude naturally rather than forcing outcomes or blaming those in authority when things don't go exactly as we want.\n\nEnglish translation: \"The sun must set so that we don't blame the owner of the day.\"\n\nThe cultural meaning implies acceptance of natural processes and timing rather than rushing or complaining about things we cannot control."

    "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down phrase by phrase:\n\n\"Mo d\u00e0gb\u00e0 mo d\u00e0g\u00f3\" - This means \"I have grown old, I have grown aged/mature\"\n\n\"ar\u00e9 \u1ecdm\u1ecdd\u00e9\" - This refers to \"the playfulness/games of children\" or \"children's play\"\n\n\"\u00f2 t\u00e1n l\u00f3j\u00fa\u00f9 mi\" - This means \"has not ended in my eyes\" or \"I still appreciate/understand\"\n\nPutting it all together, the English translation would be:\n\n\"Though I have grown old, I still appreciate the playfulness of children.\"\n\nThe meaning behind this proverb is that despite aging, one should maintain connection with youthful energy and not lose the ability to understand or appreciate the enthusiasm and playfulness of the younger generation. It speaks to wisdom that includes maintaining perspective across generations."

    "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step.\n\nFirst, let me analyze the components:\n- \"Ol\u00f3b\u00ecnrin\" means \"woman\" or \"a woman\"\n- \"kan\" means \"one\" or \"a single\"\n- \"k\u00ec \u00ed\" is a negative marker meaning \"does not\" or \"cannot\"\n- \"pa\" means \"to kill\" or \"to finish\"\n- \"agbo\" means \"herd\" or \"group\"\n- \"\u00ecja\" means \"fight\" or \"quarrel\"\n\nPutting these together literally: \"A single woman cannot end/finish a group/herd of fights.\"\n\nThe meaning of this proverb is: \"A single woman cannot resolve all disputes\" or more idiomatically, \"One woman cannot settle all quarrels.\"\n\nThe proverb essentially conveys that some problems or disputes are too large or complex for one person to resolve alone, particularly emphasizing that even with a woman's traditionally recognized role in mediation and peacekeeping in Yoruba culture, there are limits to what one person can accomplish."
