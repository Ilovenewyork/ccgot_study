When you oppose or argue with someone in power (the king), you should expect repercussions not just from them directly, but also from those who serve them (the king's messengers).\n\nThe proverb warns that challenging authority doesn't happen in isolation - those who are loyal to the authority figure will also retaliate against you. It highlights the interconnected nature of power structures and how confronting the leader often means dealing with their entire support system.\n\nIn contemporary contexts, this proverb might apply to situations like confronting a boss and then experiencing coldness from colleagues, or criticizing a community leader and finding yourself ostracized by community members.\n\nThe wisdom here is about understanding the full consequences of your actions when challenging established power."
