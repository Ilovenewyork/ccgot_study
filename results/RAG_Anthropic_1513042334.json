  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:** \"One does not keep silent and misspeak; one does not stare fixedly and be guilty of wrongdoing.\"\n\n**Meaning:** This proverb emphasizes that silence cannot be misinterpreted as saying the wrong thing, and mere observation cannot be considered a crime or offense. \n\n**Explanation:** The proverb teaches about the safety of restraint and observation. It suggests that:\n\n1. If you remain silent, you cannot be accused of saying something inappropriate or offensive.\n2. If you are simply observing a situation (looking on) without taking action, you cannot be held responsible for wrongdoing.\n\nThe wisdom here lies in recognizing that sometimes the safest course of action is non-action - neither speaking nor intervening. It counsels discretion and advises people to be mindful that active participation (through words or deeds) creates accountability, while observation and silence keep one free from blame.\n\nThis is similar to English expressions like \"Silence cannot be misquoted\" or \"You can't get in trouble for what you don't say.\""
