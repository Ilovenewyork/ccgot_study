  "gen": "Let me translate this Yoruba proverb step by step:\n\nFirst, let me break down each part of the proverb:\n- \"\u00c0b\u00far\u00f2 r\u1eb9\" = Your younger sibling/brother/sister\n- \"\u0144d\u00e1\u1e63\u1ecd f\u00fan \u1ecd\" = is sewing clothes for you\n- \"o n\u00ed o \u00f2 lo el\u00e9kuru\" = you say you don't wear clothes made of ekuru (a type of bean cake) seller's cloth\n- \"ta n\u00ed \u0144lo al\u00e1k\u00e0r\u00e0?\" = who wears cloth from an akara (bean fritter) seller?\n\nPutting it together, the literal translation is:\n\"Your younger sibling is sewing clothes for you, you say you don't wear clothes from an ekuru seller; who wears clothes from an akara seller?\"\n\nThe meaning in English would be:\n\"Your younger sibling offers to make clothes for you, but you reject them claiming they're not good enough (like an ekuru seller's cloth); yet who actually wears even lower quality clothes (like those from an akara seller)?\"\n\nThis proverb criticizes being ungrateful or rejecting help while being in no position to be picky. It warns against looking down on assistance from family members when you have no better alternative."
