  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb, I'll break it down into components and analyze it step by step.\n\n1) \"Al\u00e1ti\u1e63e\" - This appears to be a compound term:\n   - \"Al\u00e1\" suggests \"one who has\" or \"one who does\"\n   - \"ti\u1e63e\" relates to \"doing\" or \"making\"\n\n2) \"n\u00ed \u1e3fm\u1ecd\" - This means \"knows\" or \"is aware of\"\n\n3) \"\u00e0ti\u1e63e\" - This refers to \"mistake,\" \"fault,\" or \"wrongdoing\"\n\n4) \"ara-a r\u1eb9\u0300\" - This means \"himself/herself\" or \"one's own self\"\n\nPutting it all together, the literal translation would be something like:\n\"One who has made mistakes knows their own mistakes.\"\n\nThe English equivalent proverb would be:\n\"The one who has erred knows their own faults.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that people are often aware of their own shortcomings or mistakes, even if they don't acknowledge them publicly. It can also imply that experience with making mistakes gives one insight into recognizing those same mistakes."
