  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"E\u0323ran k\u00ed la \u00f2 j\u1eb9 r\u00ed? \u00d2\u0323po\u0300\u0323lo\u0301\u0323 b\u00e1ni l\u00e1b\u00e0t\u00e0 \u00f3 ba b\u00far\u00fab\u00far\u00fa\" can be translated to English as \"What kind of meat have we not eaten before? When a frog gets into the soup, it becomes a problem.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb is used to express the idea that people often encounter various challenges or experiences in life, but some situations or problems can be particularly troublesome or unpleasant. The mention of \"meat\" symbolizes different experiences or challenges one might face, while the \"frog in the soup\" represents an unexpected or particularly difficult problem that disrupts the norm. It highlights the notion that while one might be accustomed to dealing with various issues, some can still be surprisingly problematic or hard to handle."
