  "gen": "Translation of the Yoruba proverb:\n\n\"The person we love is different from the one who says there is nobody like them.\"\n\nThis proverb contrasts genuine love with arrogance or self-importance. It suggests that the person worthy of our love or affection (who may be humble) is different from someone who boasts that they are unique or incomparable."
