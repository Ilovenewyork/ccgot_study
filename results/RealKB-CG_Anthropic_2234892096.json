This suggests a theme of \"like treating like\" or using appropriate methods for specific situations.\n3. The similar phrase indicates that things are categorized or addressed based on their demonstrated nature, not just their inherent identity.\n\nInterim Insight: The original proverb may involve addressing something using methods derived from or appropriate to its own nature.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\n> Provide a literal English translation of the proverb.\n\nTranslation: \"It is the mute person's sword that is used to kill a mute person.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: Y\u00edy\u1eb9\u0301 l\u00e0 \u0144y\u1eb9\u0301 \u00d2k\u00f3r\u00f3 s\u00ed t\u00ed \u00e0 \u0144p\u00e8 \u00e9 n\u00edgi ob\u00ec; ob\u00ec t\u00ed \u00ec b\u00e1 so l\u00f3r\u00ed \u1eb9\u0300 n\u00ed \u0144ya abid\u00fan.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\n> Explain how this phrase adds depth or cultural nuance to the meaning.\n\nChain-of-Thought:\n1.

This proverb emphasizes that things are defined by their actions or results, not just by their appearance or claims.\n3. There's a theme of authenticity and appropriate response based on demonstrated behavior.\n\nInterim Insight: The original proverb suggests that the most effective way to deal with someone is to use methods they understand or that match their own approach - especially when dealing with difficult people.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It is the mute person's sword that is used to kill a mute person.\"\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb teaches that the most effective way to address a challenge is to use methods familiar to or derived from the source of the challenge itself. When dealing with difficult people or situations, using approaches they understand or that match their own tactics is often most effective. The proverb specifically uses the image of a mute person, suggesting that specialized knowledge or insider understanding is needed to effectively address specialized challenges. This reflects the Yoruba wisdom of strategic thinking and cultural emphasis on appropriate, targeted responses rather than generic solutions.\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces that things must be addressed according to their demonstrated nature. Similar Phrase 2 emphasizes that authentic action defines identity and determines appropriate response.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"Id\u00e0 ahun la fi \u0144pa ahun\" literally means \"It is the mute person's sword that is used to kill a mute person.\" In Yoruba wisdom, this conveys that the most effective way to address a challenging person or situation is to use methods derived from or familiar to that very source. Just as only another mute person fully understands how to communicate with a mute person, sometimes the solution to a problem must come from understanding the problem's own nature. This reflects the Yoruba cultural value of strategic wisdom and appropriate, targeted responses rather than generic approaches."
