  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Af\u00ednj\u00fa n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 iw\u1ecd; o\u0300\u0323mo\u0300\u0323r\u00e0n n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 ob\u00ec; m\u00e0r\u00ed-m\u00e0j\u1eb9 n\u00ed \u0144j\u1eb9 aw\u00f9s\u00e1\" can be translated to English as \"The fastidious eats shea butter; the wise eats kola nut; the indiscriminate eater eats locust bean.\"\n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb highlights the different choices people make based on their characteristics or dispositions. Each type of person is associated with a particular food item that metaphorically represents their nature or approach to life:\n\n1. **Af\u00ednj\u00fa (The fastidious or meticulous person)**: This person is described as eating \"i\u0300w\u1ecd\" (shea butter), which is often associated with refinement and care. It suggests that meticulous people are selective and prefer things that are smooth and refined.\n\n2. **O\u0300\u0323mo\u0300\u0323r\u00e0n (The wise person)**: This person eats \"ob\u00ec\" (kola nut), which is a symbol of wisdom and knowledge in Yoruba culture. Kola nuts are often used in traditional ceremonies and are associated with thoughtfulness and insight.\n\n3. **M\u00e0r\u00ed-m\u00e0j\u1eb9 (The indiscriminate eater)**: This person eats \"aw\u00f9s\u00e1\" (locust bean), which is a common and less refined food item. It implies that those who are not selective or discerning will consume whatever is available, without much thought or care.\n\nOverall, the proverb emphasizes the idea that people's choices reflect their personalities and values. It suggests that being selective and wise in one's choices is preferable to being indiscriminate."
