  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0gb\u00e0 t\u00ed k\u00f2 l\u00e9\u0323s\u00e8\u0323 n\u00edl\u00e8\u0323 a lo\u0301\u0323gbo\u0301\u0323n n\u00edn\u00fa\" can be translated to English as \"An elder who is not grounded has wisdom within.\" \n\nExplanation:\nIn Yoruba culture, elders are often seen as custodians of wisdom and experience. The proverb suggests that even if an elder does not have a strong physical presence or influence (i.e., \"not grounded\"), they still possess valuable wisdom and insight (\"has wisdom within\"). It emphasizes the importance of inner wisdom and knowledge over external appearances or status. This proverb encourages respect for the wisdom of elders, regardless of their current standing or influence in the community."
