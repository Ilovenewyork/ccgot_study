It suggests that it's better to not have power at all than to have a position of authority but be ineffective or incapable of fulfilling its responsibilities. In Yoruba culture, leadership comes with expectations of effectiveness and impact. The proverb criticizes those who accept positions but then make excuses for their ineffectiveness (\"my voice cannot reach the whole town\"). It encourages people to honestly assess their capabilities before taking on responsibilities, as having a title without the ability to fulfill its duties is worse than not having the title at all. The proverb values integrity and effectiveness over mere status or titles.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase highlights the cultural importance of having recognized status in society, while the second phrase warns against taking on responsibilities beyond one's capacity. Together, they frame the main proverb as a teaching about the proper relationship between status, capability, and responsibility in Yoruba culture."
