  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\u00cc\u1e63\u00e8\u0323 \u00f2 ti ib\u00eckan m\u00fa \u1eb9ni**: \n   - \"\u00cc\u1e63\u00e8\u0323\" means \"poverty\" or \"hardship.\"\n   - \"\u00f2 ti ib\u00eckan m\u00fa\" means \"does not hold anyone from one place.\"\n   - \"\u1eb9ni\" means \"a person\" or \"anyone.\"\n   - So, this part translates to \"Poverty does not hold anyone from one place.\"\n\n2. **\u00ecy\u00e0 \u00f2 tib\u00eckan j\u1eb9 \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n**: \n   - \"\u00ecy\u00e0\" means \"suffering\" or \"hardship.\"\n   - \"\u00f2 tib\u00eckan j\u1eb9\" means \"does not consume from one place.\"\n   - \"\u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n\" means \"a person\" or \"people.\"\n   - This translates to \"Suffering does not consume a person from one place.\"\n\n3. **b\u00ed o b\u00e1 r\u00ecnr\u00ecn \u00f2\u1e63\u00ec, b\u00ed o b\u00e1 oj\u00fa \u00ec\u1e63\u00e9\u0323 wo\u0300\u0323l\u00fa**: \n   - \"b\u00ed o b\u00e1\" means \"if you.\"\n   - \"r\u00ecnr\u00ecn \u00f2\u1e63\u00ec\" means \"walk in poverty.\"\n   - \"oj\u00fa \u00ec\u1e63\u00e9\u0323\" means \"face hardship.\"\n   - \"wo\u0300\u0323l\u00fa\" means \"enter a town\" or \"arrive in a town.\"\n   - This translates to \"if you walk in poverty, if you face hardship and enter a town.\"\n\n4. **igb\u00e1-k\u00fagb\u00e1 ni w\u1ecdn \u00f3 fi bu omi f\u00fan \u1eb9 mu**: \n   - \"igb\u00e1-k\u00fagb\u00e1\" refers to a \"small calabash\" or \"small bowl.\"\n   - \"ni w\u1ecdn \u00f3 fi bu omi f\u00fan \u1eb9 mu\" means \"they will use to fetch water for you to drink.\"\n   - This translates to \"they will use a small calabash to fetch water for you to drink.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as:\n\"Poverty does not hold anyone from one place; suffering does not consume a person from one place. If you walk in poverty and face hardship when you enter a town, they will use a small calabash to fetch water for you to drink.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that hardship and poverty are not permanent states tied to a specific location, and when you encounter them, people may offer only minimal assistance."
