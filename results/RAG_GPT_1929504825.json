  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0fi ohun t\u00ed a k\u00ec \u00ed t\u00e0 lo\u0301\u0323j\u00e0 l\u1eb9r\u00fa k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\" can be translated to English as \"A slave does not eat what is not sold in the market.\" \n\nExplanation:\nThis proverb highlights the idea of limitations and boundaries, particularly in the context of social or economic status. It suggests that a person, especially one in a subordinate position (like a slave), is restricted to what is available or permissible within their environment or circumstances. In a broader sense, it can be interpreted to mean that people should not overstep their bounds or attempt to acquire things that are beyond their reach or not meant for them. It emphasizes the importance of understanding one's place and acting within the limits of one's role or situation."
