  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u1eccjo\u0301\u0323 kan \u1e63o\u1e63o l\u00e0 \u0144t\u00e9\u0323; ojooj\u00famo\u0301\u0323 loj\u00fa \u0144tini\" translates to \"It is only one day that we use to spoil things; every day the eyes are red.\" \n\nExplanation: This proverb highlights the idea that it takes only a moment or a single day to cause damage or ruin something, but the consequences or the stress from that action can linger and affect us continuously. The \"red eyes\" symbolize the ongoing stress, worry, or regret that follows a hasty or destructive action. It serves as a caution to be mindful of our actions, as their impact can be long-lasting."
