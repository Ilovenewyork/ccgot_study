  "gen": "To translate this Yoruba proverb into English, I'll break it down step by step:\n\nFirst part: \"B\u00ed a b\u00e1 ti m\u1ecd l\u00e0 \u0144d\u00e9\"\n- \"B\u00ed\" means \"as,\" \"if,\" or \"the way that\"\n- \"a b\u00e1 ti m\u1ecd\" means \"one knows\" or \"according to one's capacity/knowledge\"\n- \"l\u00e0 \u0144d\u00e9\" means \"is how one arrives\" or \"is how one presents oneself\"\n\nSecond part: \"a-l\u00e1\u00ec-l\u1eb9\u0301\u1e63in k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e9 w\u1ecd\u0300nw\u1ecd\u0300n\"\n- \"a-l\u00e1\u00ec-l\u1eb9\u0301\u1e63in\" means \"one who doesn't have a horse\" or \"one without resources\"\n- \"k\u00ec \u00ed d\u00e9 w\u1ecd\u0300nw\u1ecd\u0300n\" means \"doesn't arrive at the same time\" or \"cannot arrive in style/grandly\"\n\nPutting it together, the proverb means:\n\n\"One arrives according to one's means; a person without a horse cannot arrive in grandeur.\"\n\nThe English equivalent meaning would be:\n\"We present ourselves according to our capabilities; a person without resources cannot make a grand appearance.\"\n\nThis proverb teaches about recognizing our limitations and living within our means, while acknowledging that different people have different resources and capabilities."
