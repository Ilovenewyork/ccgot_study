  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"\u00c0f\u00f2pin\u00e1 t\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 pa f\u00ect\u00edl\u00e0, ara \u00e8\u0323 ni y\u00f3 pa\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **\u00c0f\u00f2pin\u00e1**: This word refers to a \"moth\" or \"insect\" that is attracted to light.\n2. **t\u00f3 n\u00ed \u00f2un \u00f3 pa f\u00ect\u00edl\u00e0**: This phrase means \"that says it will extinguish the lamp.\" Here, \"\u00f2un\" means \"it,\" \"\u00f3\" is a future tense marker meaning \"will,\" \"pa\" means \"extinguish\" or \"put out,\" and \"f\u00ect\u00edl\u00e0\" means \"lamp.\"\n3. **ara \u00e8\u0323 ni y\u00f3 pa**: This part translates to \"it is itself that will be destroyed.\" \"Ara \u00e8\u0323\" means \"itself,\" \"ni\" is an emphasis marker, \"y\u00f3\" is another future tense marker meaning \"will,\" and \"pa\" in this context means \"destroy\" or \"kill.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated as: \"The moth that says it will extinguish the lamp will destroy itself.\"\n\nThis proverb conveys the idea that someone who attempts to harm or undermine something greater than themselves may end up causing their own downfall."
