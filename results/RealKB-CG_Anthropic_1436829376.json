  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\"Mo y\u00f3\" \u0144j\u1eb9\u0301 \"mo y\u00f3,\" \"mo k\u1ecd\u0300\" \u0144j\u1eb9\u0301 \"mo k\u1ecd\u0300\"; j\u1eb9un \u01f9\u1e63\u00f3, \u00e0gb\u00e0 \u1ecd\u0300k\u00e1nj\u00faw\u00e0 ni.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Ta n\u00ed m\u1ecd \u00d2kolo l\u00d3y\u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301?\" translates to \"Who knows Okolo in Oyo?\" This is typically used to indicate someone or something insignificant or unknown in a big place.\n2. This phrase suggests themes of recognition, identity, and status within a community.\n3. It hints at the importance of self-awareness and knowing one's place in society.\n\nInterim Insight: The first proverb suggests that in Yoruba culture, understanding one's social position is important. This relates to our main proverb which appears to address behaviors around food and satisfaction, possibly highlighting individualistic versus communal attitudes.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"I am full\" means \"I am full,\" \"I refuse\" means \"I refuse\"; eating alone, (this is) an elder with selfish character.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"Mo m\u1ecc\u0300b\u00e0r\u00e0 mo m\u1ecc\u0300f\u00fan\" ti k\u00ec \u00ed j\u1eb9\u0301 k\u00ed \u00e0w\u00f2ko k\u1ecd\u0301 \u1ecd\u0300p\u1eb9\u0301\u1eb9\u0300r\u1eb9\u0301 n\u00cdf\u00e1\" roughly translates to \"Saying 'I know this, I know that' prevents the parrot from learning Ifa divination.\"\n2. This proverb warns against pride and over-confidence that prevents learning and growth.\n3. It emphasizes the value of humility and openness to continued learning in Yoruba wisdom traditions.\n\nInterim Insight: This phrase highlights how self-satisfaction and pride can prevent growth and proper social conduct. This connects to our main proverb by reinforcing that selfish behavior (like eating alone) reflects poorly on one's character, especially for someone who should know better (an elder).\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n\n- Final Translation: \"When I say 'I am satisfied,' it means I am truly satisfied; when I say 'I decline,' it means I truly decline; one who eats alone is an elder with a selfish character.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb criticizes selfish behavior, particularly around food sharing which is sacred in African cultures. It specifically condemns elders who eat alone, as they should be exemplars of community values. In Yoruba society, sharing food is a fundamental expression of community, and refusing to share (especially by respected elders) represents a serious moral failing. The proverb teaches that true wisdom includes generosity and community-mindedness, not just age or status. It warns against self-centered attitudes that place individual satisfaction above communal welfare.\n\n- References: The first similar phrase (\"Who knows Okolo in Oyo?\") reminds us of the importance of social recognition and proper conduct within the community. The second phrase about the parrot unable to learn Ifa reinforces how pride and self-satisfaction prevent proper growth and social development, much like the selfish elder who eats alone has failed to develop proper character despite their age.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb criticizes selfishness, particularly in elders who should know better. In Yoruba culture, eating alone is considered deeply selfish, as sharing food is a fundamental social obligation. The proverb uses the contrast between personal satisfaction (\"I am full\") and social responsibility to teach that true wisdom includes generosity, not just age. It serves as a warning against putting individual desires above community welfare."
