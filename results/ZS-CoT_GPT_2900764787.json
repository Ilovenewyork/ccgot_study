  "gen": "To translate the Yoruba proverb \"N\u00edgb\u00e0t\u00ed \u00e0 \u0144to \u1ecdk\u00e0 a \u00f2 to ti \u1eb9mo\u0301\u0323 si\" into English, let's break it down step by step:\n\n1. **N\u00edgb\u00e0t\u00ed** - This means \"when\" or \"while.\"\n2. **\u00e0 \u0144to** - This phrase means \"we are arranging\" or \"we are organizing.\"\n3. **\u1ecdk\u00e0** - This refers to \"corn\" or \"maize.\"\n4. **a \u00f2 to** - This means \"we do not arrange\" or \"we do not organize.\"\n5. **ti \u1eb9mo\u0301\u0323 si** - \"ti\" is a possessive marker, and \"\u1eb9mo\u0301\u0323\" means \"sorghum.\" \"Si\" in this context can imply \"as well\" or \"also.\"\n\nPutting it all together, the proverb can be translated to English as: \"While we are arranging the corn, we do not arrange the sorghum as well.\"\n\nThis proverb suggests that one should focus on one task at a time rather than trying to do everything at once."
