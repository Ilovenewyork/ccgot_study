  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"\u00d3 y\u1eb9 \u1eb9ni gbogbo k\u00f3 d\u00ednw\u00f3 ar\u00f3, k\u00f2 y\u1eb9 at\u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e9.\"\n\n## Step 0 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 1: \u00d3 y\u1eb9 \u1eb9ni gbogbo k\u00f3 s\u1ecd p\u00e9 i\u1e63u \u00f2 jin\u00e1, k\u00f2 y\u1eb9 alub\u00e0t\u00e1.\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This similar phrase follows the same structure: \"It is fitting for everyone to say [something], but not fitting for [specific person].\"\n2. In this phrase, \"i\u1e63u \u00f2 jin\u00e1\" means \"yam is not hot/burning\" and \"alub\u00e0t\u00e1\" refers to a drummer who plays the talking drum.\n3. The phrase suggests that while everyone can comment on the temperature of yams, it would be inappropriate for a drummer to do so, as they should be focused on their craft.\n4. This establishes a pattern where the proverb contrasts general behavior with specialized responsibility.\n\nInterim Insight: The structure suggests our target proverb likely contrasts general communal behavior with the specialized responsibility of a particular role or person.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"It is fitting for everyone to reduce the cost of indigo dye, but not fitting for the dyer.\"\n\n## Step 3 \u2013 Context Injection\nSimilar Phrase 2: \u00d3 y\u1eb9 \u1eb9ni gbogbo k\u00f3 s\u1ecd p\u00e9 \"\u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301run a-\u1e63\u00e8kan-m\u00e1-k\u00f9,\" k\u00f2 y\u1eb9 ak\u00fak\u00f3.\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. This second similar phrase maintains the same structure but with different content.\n2. \"\u1eccl\u1ecd\u0301run a-\u1e63\u00e8kan-m\u00e1-k\u00f9\" is a praise name for God meaning \"God who does things once and perfectly.\"\n3. \"Ak\u00fak\u00f3\" refers to a rooster, which crows repeatedly, contrasting with the once-and-perfect nature attributed to God.\n4. This reinforces the idea that these proverbs highlight contradictions between general statements and specific roles or characteristics.\n\nInterim Insight: The pattern confirms that the target proverb is about how certain actions or statements may be acceptable from the general public but inappropriate from specialists whose livelihood depends on the very thing being discussed.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"It is fitting for everyone to advocate for lower prices of indigo dye, but not fitting for the dyer (whose livelihood depends on it).\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This Yoruba proverb highlights the conflict between community interests and individual professional interests. While the general public may reasonably want lower prices for goods like indigo dye, it would be self-defeating for the dyer (at\u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e9) to advocate for the same, as their livelihood depends on fair compensation for their specialized work. The proverb teaches about the importance of recognizing different perspectives based on one's position and role in society. It warns against expecting people to act against their own legitimate interests, while acknowledging that community and individual needs may sometimes be in tension.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 (about yams and drummers) and Similar Phrase 2 (about God's perfection and roosters) both follow the same pattern of contrasting general statements with specialized roles, reinforcing the interpretation of conflicting perspectives based on one's position in society.\n\nFinal Answer: The proverb \"\u00d3 y\u1eb9 \u1eb9ni gbogbo k\u00f3 d\u00ednw\u00f3 ar\u00f3, k\u00f2 y\u1eb9 at\u1ecd\u0300\u1ecd\u0301l\u00e9\" translates to \"It is fitting for everyone to advocate for lower prices of indigo dye, but not fitting for the dyer.\" This Yoruba wisdom highlights how perspectives and appropriate behaviors differ based on one's role in society. While consumers naturally want lower prices, a craftsperson cannot reasonably devalue their own work and products. The proverb teaches respect for specialized knowledge and legitimate self-interest, while acknowledging the natural tension between community desires and professional sustainability."
