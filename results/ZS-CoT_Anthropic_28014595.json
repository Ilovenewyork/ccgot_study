  "gen": "I'll translate this Yoruba proverb step by step.\n\nFirst, let me break down the components:\n- \"B\u00ed ba\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300-\u1eb9\u0301 b\u00e1 \u0144t\u00e0k\u00ect\u00ec\" - This first part refers to the landlord/household head (ba\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300) doing something characterized as \"t\u00e0k\u00ect\u00ec\" (staggering or dancing wildly)\n- \"\u00f2r\u00f3gi\" - refers to the top of a tree\n- \"l\u00e0 \u1e3fb\u00e1 \u1eb9m\u1eb9s\u1eb9\u0300\" - indicates where one meets or encounters something\n\nThe literal translation would be something like: \"If the landlord/household head is dancing wildly/staggering, one meets the tenants/household members at the treetop.\"\n\nThe meaning of this proverb is: \"When a leader behaves irresponsibly or acts foolishly, his followers will go to extremes or act even more irrationally.\"\n\nIn English, we might express this sentiment as: \"When the master goes crazy, the servants go wild\" or \"As goes the leader, so go the followers, but often to greater extremes.\"\n\nThe proverb teaches about the influence of leadership and how people tend to follow their leader's example, sometimes taking it even further."
