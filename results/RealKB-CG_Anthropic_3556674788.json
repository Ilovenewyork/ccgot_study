  "gen": "# Task: Translate and interpret the proverb \"K\u00e0k\u00e0 k\u00e1 d\u1ecd\u0300b\u00e1l\u1eb9\u0300 f\u00fan G\u00e0m\u0300b\u00e0r\u00ed, k\u00e1 r\u1ecd\u0301j\u00fa k\u00e1 k\u00fa.\"\n\n## Step 1 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 1\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. The similar phrase \"K\u00e0k\u00e0 k\u00ed \u00e0gb\u00f2 k\u00e9, \u00e0gb\u00f2 a k\u00fa\" translates to \"Rather than for the ram to bleat, the ram would die.\"\n2. This suggests a theme of maintaining dignity or pride even in difficult situations - the ram would rather die than make a sound showing weakness.\n3. The imagery conveys choosing a difficult but dignified option over one that might be easier but humiliating.\n4. This helps me understand the original proverb likely contrasts two choices: submission to someone (prostrating to the Gambari/Hausa person) versus maintaining dignity even at great cost.\n\nInterim Insight: The proverb appears to be about choosing death with dignity over living with humiliation or submission.\n\n## Step 2 \u2013 Literal Translation\nTranslation: \"Rather than prostrate (bow down) for a Hausa man (Gambari), it's better to endure and die.\"\n\n## Step 4 \u2013 Reasoning with Similar Phrase 2\nChain-of-Thought:\n1. \"K\u00e1 r\u00edni s\u1ecd\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300 f\u00fanni \u00f2 d\u00e0b\u00ed-i k\u00e1 s\u1ecd\u0300r\u1ecd\u0300 f\u00fanni k\u00e1 gb\u00e0\" translates to \"Having someone to speak to is not the same as having someone who listens and accepts what you say.\"\n2. This proverb emphasizes the distinction between superficial interaction and genuine understanding or respect.\n3. In relation to the original proverb, it suggests there's a cultural context about relationships between different ethnic groups (Yoruba and Hausa) where true respect might be lacking.\n4. It adds a layer about dignity and being acknowledged properly versus merely going through motions of respect without genuine reciprocity.\n\nInterim Insight: The original proverb likely refers to maintaining one's cultural dignity rather than submitting to someone who may not truly respect you or your culture.\n\n## Final Synthesis:\n- Final Translation: \"Rather than prostrate before a Hausa man (in humiliation), it is better to face hardship and die with dignity.\"\n\n- Culturally-Grounded Interpretation: This proverb reflects the historical ethnic tensions between Yoruba and Hausa peoples in Nigeria. In Yoruba culture, prostrating is a sign of respect, but the proverb suggests that maintaining one's dignity and cultural integrity is more important than submitting to someone who may not reciprocate that respect. It speaks to the importance of honor and self-respect in Yoruba culture, suggesting that death with dignity is preferable to life with humiliation. The proverb teaches that one should not compromise fundamental values and personal dignity even in challenging circumstances.\n\n- References: Similar Phrase 1 reinforces the concept of dignity before submission, while Similar Phrase 2 highlights the importance of genuine respect rather than superficial acknowledgment in interpersonal relationships."
