  "gen": "# Translation and Explanation of the Yoruba Proverb\n\n**Literal translation:** \"The size of a rat determines the size of its trap; a cat does not carry what is too heavy for it.\"\n\n**Meaning:** This proverb teaches about knowing one's limitations and capabilities. It suggests that every person has their natural capacity or limit, just as a trap must be proportional to the rat it aims to catch, and a cat will not attempt to carry what is beyond its strength.\n\n**Cultural explanation:** In Yoruba wisdom, this proverb emphasizes the importance of self-awareness and recognizing one's boundaries. It counsels against attempting tasks beyond one's abilities or means. The imagery of the rat trap needing to match the rat's size, and the cat knowing not to attempt carrying excessive loads, illustrates how nature itself demonstrates the principle of operating within one's capacity.\n\nThis proverb would be used to advise someone to be realistic about their abilities, to avoid overreaching, and to understand that success comes from working within one's natural capabilities rather than attempting the impossible."
