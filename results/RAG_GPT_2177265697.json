  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"E\u0323ni \u00e0 \u0144gb\u00e9 g\u00e8\u0323g\u00e8\u0323 ni y\u00f3 ba ara-a r\u00e8\u0323 j\u00e9\u0323\" can be translated to English as \"The person who is carried like a calabash will spoil themselves.\" \n\nExplanation: In Yoruba culture, a \"g\u00e8\u0323g\u00e8\u0323\" refers to a calabash, which is often used to carry things. The proverb suggests that someone who is constantly being helped or carried by others, without making efforts on their own, will eventually harm themselves or fail to develop self-reliance. It emphasizes the importance of personal responsibility and the potential negative consequences of over-dependence on others."
