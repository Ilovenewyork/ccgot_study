  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"Id\u00e0 ahun la fi \u0144pa ahun\" translates to \"It is with the sword of the tortoise that we kill the tortoise.\" \n\nThis proverb conveys the idea that the solution to a problem often lies within the problem itself, or that the means to overcome a challenge can be found in the challenge. It suggests that sometimes, the tools or resources needed to address an issue are inherent in the situation. In a broader sense, it can also imply that one can use the characteristics or weaknesses of an adversary against them."
