  "gold": "Destitution does not attach to one at a particular place; suffering does not attack a person at a particular place; if one walks like a wretch into a town, if one looks like a loser when one enters a town, it is with a miserable calabash that the people will offer one water to drink.",
  "gen": "The Yoruba proverb \"\u00cc\u1e63\u00e8\u0323 \u00f2 ti ib\u00eckan m\u00fa \u1eb9ni; \u00ecy\u00e0 \u00f2 tib\u00eckan j\u1eb9 \u00e8\u00e8y\u00e0n; b\u00ed o b\u00e1 r\u00ecnr\u00ecn \u00f2\u1e63\u00ec, b\u00ed o b\u00e1 oj\u00fa \u00ec\u1e63\u00e9\u0323 wo\u0300\u0323l\u00fa, igb\u00e1-k\u00fagb\u00e1 ni w\u1ecdn \u00f3 fi bu omi f\u00fan \u1eb9 mu\" can be translated to English as:\n\n\"Poverty does not come from one place; suffering does not affect a person from one direction; if you wander in poverty and look at the world through the lens of hardship, they will serve you water in a broken calabash.\"\n\nExplanation:\n\nThis proverb highlights the idea that poverty and suffering are not caused by a single factor or source. Instead, they can arise from various circumstances and directions. It suggests that when someone is experiencing hardship, they may be treated with less respect or given inadequate resources, as symbolized by being served water in a broken calabash. The proverb serves as a reflection on the nature of poverty and the societal attitudes towards those who are struggling, emphasizing the multifaceted nature of hardship and the often unsympathetic response from society."
