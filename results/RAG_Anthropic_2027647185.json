It cautions against assuming superiority over someone you're meant to help.\n\nThe proverb uses the context of If\u00e1 divination, a traditional Yoruba spiritual practice where a priest consults the oracle to provide guidance. In this relationship, while the diviner has knowledge, they shouldn't be condescending or think themselves intellectually superior to their client.\n\nThe deeper wisdom is about humility in advisory roles - whether as a counselor, teacher, or guide. It reminds us that providing guidance requires respect and acknowledging that the person seeking help has their own wisdom and agency in applying the advice they receive.\n\nThis proverb teaches the importance of respectful counsel without presuming to know better than those we serve."
